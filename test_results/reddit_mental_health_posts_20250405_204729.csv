Eirwynzure,"Hi everyone, I really wanted to do/felt like I should make a separate master-post for how I overcame DPDR (depersonalization and derealization) that was triggered by long-term anxiety, as well as some of the symptoms, mechanisms of DPDR, feedback loop, triggers & more.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre, rarely spoken about, constant symptoms of long-term anxiety, and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below, I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit, and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning, this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note, and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant, anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%, it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR, the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR, no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis, and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**, which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind, by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks, severe stress, health anxiety, drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens), traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations, abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you, environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D, like it isn't quite real or tangible, others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred, like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body, everything feels disconnected, like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small, too big, like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't), woozy head feelings, fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb, like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop, what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into, which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack, but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die, that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations, that you could collapse any moment now, and then it goes... but you're on edge, what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying, I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations, you're scared it will happen again, you're getting waves of dread, your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day, nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more, you feel like you're slipping away, you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal, and it does, its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack, was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**, but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it, you are now in fear, in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening, your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next, after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood, which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source, this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances, anxiety attacks, depression, stress, medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce, sexual assaults/CSA, PTSD, DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs, stressful/abusive relationships, difficult home life, being a full-time carer for family, difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR, such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies), CBT, DBT, EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself, as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you, and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies, but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related, it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**, as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs, what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms, and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it, and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR, or how it makes you feel, 'scanning' for feelings or signs of it, and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**, whether it is your hobbies, being with your friends and family, doing chores that need to be done, starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary, even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal, like you're not present or that the world is slipping away, but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight, this is because your body hormonally, needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately, the body wouldn't be able to cope, so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time, and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat, but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own, and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it, 'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life, would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this, you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things, DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain, your fear, your trauma, your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better, albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms, I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey, I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal, or because the world feels distorted, you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps, and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces, engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers, family, partners), if you can touch their face then touch it, grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes, they are [insert colour], they have a [description] nose, do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small, short walks up and down your street, to eventually longer walks, acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe, be kind & go home if you need it, try again another day, stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant, and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant, or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them, and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life, and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things, not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state, but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see, name 4 things you can touch and to touch them, naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them, what 2 things can you smell, 1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes, putting your hands in cold water, picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold, warm, does it feel rough or soft), identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music, tuning into the sounds of your steps, counting your steps, observing your surroundings on your walks, sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name, your age, where you live, what street you live on, the date, where you are, what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as, ''You are okay'', ''Nothing can hurt me'', ''You will get through this'', ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR, so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god, no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real, I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations, and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort, while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer, or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home), and I would feel unreal, like everything was flat, like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back, that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs, eating things I really loved, engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more, I started to stand more, I started to go out more and for much, much longer each time, I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong, I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me, as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better, so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days, anxious days, stressful days) because when you do, you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself, being more present, doing my hobbies, going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped, **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real, everything looked so colorful, the world didn't feel flat or distorted, everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness, my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while, but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it, because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality, it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready, the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust, those tools, in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into, and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely, as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body, and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body, and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions, get in touch with services that can help you taper, detox or navigate potential sobriety, do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**, ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid, alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation, and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice, but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors, anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get, and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms, heart rhythms, the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog, low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy, functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them, identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety, when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time, the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

SilentBorderline,"Years ago when I was 15, I got psychologically evaluated. My iq was a bit difficult to determine due to how dysfunctionally depressed I was. (GAD/MDD/PTSD/ADHD/Substance Abuse diagnosed) It was around the 70s’, however she estimated around 82 iq overall. 

In my junior year I was the only kid that didn’t finish the ACT on time. Even with an extension from my 504 plan. 

Weeks ago I was curious about my iq again, thinking maybe the test was wrong cause I was a kid with several untreated mental problems. Im currently on meds, and in therapy. Also off most drugs but weed and nicotine. I took an iq test online— look I’m aware people say those aren’t the most accurate. Plus my drug use at a young age…But I didn’t expect to get exactly 82 iq again. Maybe atleast average. That triggered my anxiety even on meds. I don’t have money to actually retake a professional test, but now I can’t stop ruminating over it. I always suffered through poor self esteem and a massive inferiority complex, with a dash of dependence and reliance on other people. I had little trust in my own judgement to begin with, but now it’s completely gone. I can’t handle such uncertainty like that. 

What if every opinion and any word out of my mouth is just…wrong? Every perspective, consideration, or reasoning I come up with feels like it’s poorly defined. I feel like theres more I should be knowing, or that I’m behind in understanding. I’ve always been a helper, I love helping people with anyway I can but I’m too scared since my problem solving skills are insufficient, what if I make things worse? Also I’m a very slow person, someone can help faster and better. 

I don’t know, I’m just scared to do anything with my brain now. I have significant trauma of feeling like so little, and the iq is almost proving those feelings as true. Im so vocal about how stupid I feel, everyone in my real life disagrees. But they could be bias. 

I can’t exactly pinpoint why it bothers me so much, I just know that my capability to do things has been a sensitive topic for me for years. It’s clear IQ isn’t what makes a whole person. So It’s probably trauma and external opinions based. Idk. Advice is welcomed but I wanted to vent somewhere. My friends and family are probably sick of hearing about it from me. 

Anxiety did nothing but ruin my self image and become so self absorbed in the little things within myself. 

Edit: I’m seeing a lot of replies within a few minutes, kind of unexpected and overwhelming- I see lots of positive comments so ty. I hope this doesn’t come off as bad in anyway. I have history of ruminating over very insignificant things .. i think this stems even deeper than just the “iq test”  

Edit 2: I just wanna say, sorry if I don’t reply back. Just know I likely have read your message and I greatly appreciate it. I think I’ll keep this post up despite the anxiety, just so I can go back on it if I ever start to spiral. 

Edit 3: Fixed errors. Also No, my post was not written by ai. 😂 Im actually considering what I can do with my writing abilities due to all the feedback I’ve gotten. It’s been very eye opening for me to gain this much input from strangers who don’t even know me. I have a lot of restructuring to do with my thoughts. Im still really young (talking fresh out of highschool) by the way. I swear, I need to go back to therapy so I can put these bad thoughts to rest. Lol.

Manny631,"I saw a post from earlier today about klonopin but it was locked. Many comments demonized benzo use, as usual. It's basically if Satan and Hitler had a baby and converted it into a tablet.


I've take a low dose of Klonopin essentially daily for many years now. I've posted about it here before but not in awhile. I've posted my story, which I'll briefly tell again:


Anxiety forever due to I believe genetic reasons and bullying growing up. Depression was there as well. In 2013 it boiled over into panic attacks and I've never been the same. I believe it was due to personal stress + first responder stress + financial stress + alcohol abuse + high caffeine intake.


Since then I've tried two dozen mental health medications for my symptoms which are anxiety, depression, brain fog, OCD and such. SSRIs helped take the edge off but chronic anxiety remained right beneath the surface. These other meds caused many other side effects from sexual dysfunction to weight gain to exacerbation of dissociation and anhedonia. I've even tried Spravato, which was tedious.


Additionally I've tried other avenues. Therapy (on number 4), supplements (Ex: L-Theanine, Taurine, probiotics, Lithium Orotate, methylfolate, and much more), hormone therapy (diagnosed low T and am on TRT), meditation, and more.


Klonopin is the only thing that helps adequately. I don't feel GREAT and still suffer daily, especially with dissociation, but klonopin makes it more tolerable. I try to not take it and power through and I regret it every single time. So what're my choices? Take it and live a more tolerable life so I can work, be present for my family, and be able to merely go shopping without feeling super dizzy and disoriented OR suffer? 


I don't abuse it recreationally, nor have I ever. I don't use illicit drugs. I don't use marijuana. I don't drink alcohol. I just want klonopin and to use it as prescribed without being demonized by others. I don't even take my full dose of .5mg, I usually take a half in the morning and maybe another quarter or half mid day as needed.


I dont think it should be the first plan of attack on anxiety, I get that. But when someone has exhausted the ""safer"" options then this should be allowed without question. How medications pcer the past decade went from them being thrown at you with ease to being super strict isn't OK. For example, pain meds. I had spine surgery and they gave me 4 pain pills.


So please don't judge.",2024-02-27 04:59:24,Unknown,310,1b0wfi5,299,anxiety,I take Klonopin daily. It's the only thing that truly helps.,0.92
tejamihir,"Hey guys, I have been an avid follower of this sub for a long time and this place has been a constant source of panic attack relievers over the last few months. In my last session with my therapist, he told me that GAD is cured after 6 months of literal hell and dedication. I want to share what worked for me.

**Background:** As with my fellow GAD sufferers, I have been suffering from constant worries and usual panic attacks over the last few years but I decided to take action about this (didn't know it was GAD back then) after a full-blown attack that lasted for hours and hours in early May this year. Started my treatment late May. In one of the panic attacks I was contemplating committing suicide but thank god I had the courage to stick to my routine.

**Symptoms:** Luckily, never had any physical symptoms but diarrohea and mouth ulcers were common because of cortisol developed by Amygdala.

**Aftermath:** I am waking up everyday with a buoyant mood and my life including social life, dating life and academic performance, all have improved!

So, let's finally begin:

1. **Therapy:** Can't emphasize this more, CBT therapists will identify the problematic and impractical thought patterns associted with your Anxiety( especially if it's Cortex-based) and suggest you ways to cope with them via ABCDE, RRR techniques and so on. Some of these will work for you will and some not but these people are medical experts and you need to spend 2-3 months with a therapist before deciding to discontinue/move to a different Therapist. Self-therapy books do help but it's always better to have someone in the form of close friend or a therapist to assist in your journey.
2. **Reading Books:** Rewire your Anxious Brain, The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety, and My Age of Anxiety,  are the top 3 books I recommend. Finally, I'd suggest reading posts on this sub. **Caution:** there are chances of feeling uneasiness or having panic attacks by reading few content so make sure you tell your brain that this is medicine beforehand
3. **Meditation:** atleast 2-3 times in a day for 12.5 mins everyday. It's only one day in the last 6 months I missed doing this wonderful thing.Buddhist style of meditation worked for me. Mantra meditation, guided meditation are other alternatives. There are wide variety of resources available online. It could be possible that you don't see the effects in the initial few weeks but I'd suggest keep doing it blindly.
4. **Gym:**  6 days a week non-stop in the last 6 months except for the weeks when I was travelling. It's scientifically proven that doing physical activity for more than 20 mins almost everyday improves mental health. Technically, doing exercises helps the body release endorphins that rearrange the synapse between the neurons if done for 10 weeks to see a significant results. This is massive in improving thought patterns
5. **Being open:** Being open about your anxiety with your closed ones will enable to learn new strategies, perspectives and many more things. More importantly, you will have shoulders to fall upon during a full-blown panic attack

**Others:** practicing gratitude daily, practicing my hobbies( soccer).

Traditional-Market85,"I understand there's a lot of stigma surrounding benzodiazepines, and I've mentioned this several times before. But here's the truth, some of us genuinely need them, just like others require insulin or beta blockers for conditions like high blood pressure.

If you're like me and have tried everything, therapy, supplements, lifestyle adjustments, for years and are still trapped in your room by debilitating anxiety, stop waiting. Seek out medication and start living your life right now, today!

Your time is now! You deserve to live in the moment.

Would you rather spend the next 20, 40, or more years bedridden just because most people are against medication?

It's strange, people accept smoking weed or drinking alcohol in excess, but the moment you take a benzo, it's considered wrong. That's unfair!

Like benzos, weed and alcohol have long-term effects. Everything does! Even the water you drink and the air you breathe contain harmful substances.

If you're constantly worrying about what will happen in 20 or 40 years, you may never truly enjoy your life.

In my family, my mom and several others have been on benzos and SSRIs for 40+ years, and they’re in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s now, completely healthy because they've never abused them.

If you need benzos every day to live a fulfilling life, go for it! Just be mindful not to misuse them.

If SSRIs are what you need, take them. Life is unpredictable, you might have a few years or several decades left, so why waste time feeling nauseous, overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts, and depressed, stuck at home?

You can live a normal life, get a job, or pursue an education. Do whatever it takes to feel better, without worrying about what others think, and focus solely on the present.

I hope everyone reading this feels better soon, just like I have since accepting that I need medication. I’m not concerned about side effects that may or may not show up in 30 or 40 years. I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

For now, I'm choosing to live my life fully, happy and functional, rather than spend decades in isolation, suffering, just because society stigmatizes medication.",2024-10-23 08:11:49,Unknown,82,1ga05rb,253,anxiety,Don't be afraid to take medication if you need it.

SunThroughTheStorm,"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much, so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

FriendLost9587,"TL;DR: I ended up in the ER and cardiology ward due to edibles. Tachycardia + anxiety attack is no fun and 24+ hours later I’m still shaky and feel “off”

tried posting this on r/trees and got predictably downvoted to hell and accused of being a shill for anti marijuana laws or some shit. 

I’ve been taking edibles for a couple years. Maybe 10, 15 times max. I’d take it months apart usually so my tolerance was really low. I’m also a 115 pound female and always seem to have strong side effects to substances. Recently had a pretty shitty case of COVID and cold so I was pretty weak physically - my first mistake.

It was the evening and I was at my parents house. They’re pretty chill about cannabis ever since it got legalized and so I took some edibles thinking it would help me relax. I took 10 mg (usually I take 5 or 7.5 mg) but recently I was worried my tolerance was going up because I wouldn’t feel much. I forgot I had a glass of wine with dinner.

Usually it takes 2 hours for the edibles to kick in. After 20 min I knew something was terribly, terribly wrong. Time seemed to be warped for me. I couldn’t focus on the TV show I was watching. I felt reality slowly fade away and I felt trapped in this strange world where I couldn’t focus on anything around me. I started to panic. My heart was racing. I ran into my bedroom and begged my mom for water as my mouth was dry.

The water wasn’t helping. I could barely tell the passage of time - was in 10 minutes or an hour? I couldn’t remember what I had said 5 minutes before. My whole spatial awareness was warped. Eventually my mom put a Fitbit on me and noticed my heart rate was 175. Here’s where things get fucked.

I lie down. I literally can’t move and voices feel warped. My whole body starts to shake and vibrate and I can’t move. I can barely speak - I want to but the words don’t come out. I vaguely hear my family yelling in the background and talking about calling 911. I keep repeating I’m going to die, and I think to myself, this is literally how I will die. My chest hurt. I was having trouble breathing. Finally my mom decides to take me to the hospital. 

The drive to the hospital was the longest of my life even though it was 15 min. I felt like my lungs were shutting down and my chest hurt. I kept repeating that I couldn’t breathe and that I was dying. I could barely see anything and I remember trying to vomit into a bag. I was in a haze as I was wheeled into the emergency room. 

Finally I was connected to an IV and given fluids and benzos. My heart rate was still 175 and finally went down to 155 after an hour but wouldn’t stabilize even with the benzos. They gave me an EKG and a chest X-ray and took blood and it came back normal except for a little spot in my lungs which they thought was related to the COVID. I was still delirious at this point.

 
Finally around 4 am my heart rate went down to 135-125 and after two additional bags of fluids and some potassium (which was low) I was admitted to the cardiology ward for further observation. I fell asleep thank goodness and woke up the following morning getting more fluids. My heart rate was still elevated to around 125 but then went down to 115 and 100. I waited for the doctor until 3 pm and he said I’d be discharged as the THC was most likely close to being out of my system and my heart rate was now at normal levels. I was basically diagnosed with tachycardia from the THC, which was exacerbated by a full blown panic attack.

I went home and that night I still felt spatially weird, shaky, and anxious. Today I feel better but my heart rate is around 100. I don’t think it’s fully out of my system yet and am now experiencing some trauma from the experience. I am scared of being alone and I am scared of going “crazy” or feeling like I am going to die again. This was easily one of the most traumatic and uncomfortable experiences of my life.

I can’t begin to describe to someone who has not gone through a full blown THC induced panic attack how terrifying the lack of control and spatial disorientation is. And the feeling that something is very, very wrong with you and all you can do is wait for it to go away. I was told on r/trees that all I needed to do was watch a movie and relax and I’d feel better. 

I wholeheartedly disagree with that as the doctors were concerned about my heart and  the fact that they admitted me to the cardiology ward means it could have been a lot more serious. 

I am recovering but I do not feel back to normal yet. Hopefully I will soon but I need to do therapy work after this. My left side of my chest still hurts sometimes and I get pangs of anxiety and panic throughout the day.

If you have anxiety please, please be careful with edibles. I am not against cannabis. It is legal in most states like alcohol. But I want to stress how dangerous the paranoia and panic can be for some people who have anxiety disorders. If this post can help one person avoid what I went through I would be so happy.

EDIT: to anyone reading this - my heart rate ultimately went back to normal, but I still feel a little “off” many days, and have suffered a few panic attacks, a nightmare about the incident and mild depersonalization/ derealization. I regret taking the edible. I’m trying to start meditation and exercise and working through this with my therapist. It’s not easy.

EDIT EDIT: Six months later, how am I doing? At first it wasn’t great. I started getting panics attacks. Existential dread. Depression. This lasted for two months. Went on Celexa in early Feb, calmed my physical anxiety. In terms of panic attacks I am doing a lot better, I have maybe once a month or less instead of every few days. I still feel scared about what happened and think I am still a little traumatized by it. I haven’t fully processed it and I think my brain processed it like a near death experience. Because that’s how it felt at the time. I consider myself very lucky. I was also slapped with a $3000 ER bill, this is after insurance, would have been $10,000 without my insurance. I have not touched THC since and honestly never will again.

YEAR AFTER EDIT:

How am I doing? Still feel like I have some underlying trauma over this episode and it kickstarted a lot of health anxiety and existential dread which still plagues me to this day. Not fun. I don’t think about the incident itself much anymore though so things are basically normal. Haven’t touched THC since and never will for the rest of my life.",2022-11-14 23:36:03,Unknown,225,yv7g5q,378,anxiety,THC edibles landed my in the ER and cardiology ward with tachycardia and an extreme panic attack.,0.92
Traditional-Market85,"I know there is a lot of stigma about benzos and I have posted several times about this. But, hey! Some of us need them! Just like some people need insuline, or beta blockers for high blood pressure.

If you are like me that has tried therapy, supplements, lifestyle changes and everything else, for several years and you still live in your room with crippling anxiety, stop that, and seek for medication and START ENJOYING YOUR LIFE NOW! TODAY! 

Your time is now! You have to live now!

Or do you prefer to be bedridden for 20, 40 or more years just because most people are against medication? 

Everyone sees people smoking weed, drinking dozens of beers everyday and it is OK, but if you take a benzo, that's wrong! Come on! 

Just like benzos, weed and alcohol has long term side effects. Everything does! Even the water that you drink and the air that you breath is full of dangerous chemicals. 

If you worry about what will happen in 20 or 40 years, you will never enjoy your life.

My mom and several people in my family have taken benzos and SSRIs for 40 or more years and they are now 65 - 90 years old and completely healthy beacause they have never abused them. 

If you need benzos everyday to enjoy your life! Do it! Just don't abuse them. 

If you need SSRIs, go and take them. You have to start living now because you don't know if you have 2, 3 or 50 years left, so you better live them instead of being inside your houses, with nausea, intrusive thoughts, and depressed. 

You can be a normal person, you can get a job, you can study a carrer. Just do what MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER, and don't care about the others, and focus only on the PRESENT. 

I hope everyone here feels better just as I have been feeling lately since I accepted that I need medication. I don't care if I get side effects in 30 or 40 years. I will deal with them later if I get any. 

My time is now, and I prefer to live the time I have left full of happiness and being a functional person, instead of spending decades in isolation and suffering just because there is a stigma about medication.

ilikedbokunopico,"A pill that takes away all of your anxiety, keeps you sober, makes you feel like before you ever had anxiety, works almost instantly, lasts all day and doesn’t bother you that there’s something different about yourself. It’s a nice thought, but not a reality for most americans under 30. Medicine like that exists though. It’s in a special class of anti-anxeity drugs called benzodiazepines. They’re controlled substances and haven’t been widely prescribed since before a lot my generation reached adolescence. Say what you want about them or the long term effects but I’d rather be addicted to a drug then gamble with allergic reactions and crippling side effects of the antidepressants that keep getting thrown at me like they’re candy. 

Some background: I have OCD, not TikTok OCD, think Sheila from the TV show Shameless type of OCD. And naturally I went to a psychiatrist to get help. I was given countless drugs since then. SSRI’s, SNRI’s, Antipsychotics, antihistamines, blood-thinners, and even a fucking seizure medication. But never a benzodiazepine. I also got therapy, did CBT, TMS, and even Exposure Therapy, nothing fucking worked. Last night I had a panic attack so bad comparable to the one that cost me my job just before I started getting help and went to the ER. I tried breathing techniques, grounding myself, and even took a blood thinner to stop all of this before I embarrassed myself at the ER again. Everything failed. The doctors saw me monitored my heart rate but when my mom told him that I had OCD he did something different. He gave me Valium. I didn’t want to take it at first because drugs scare me. But after I took it about 30 minutes later, I felt like a human being. I kept flinching at things expecting anxiety, but no anxiety ever came. It took everything I feared away, left me conscious, and made me able to enjoy things like TV and warmth. Before I went to bed I almost cried knowing that this will be over tomorrow and eventually I’ll be back to my old self. Because I was given Valium I have an actual chance to get a prescription for it now, not a good chance, but a chance and that brings me some peace. Because I always knew that if they gave me the “good stuff” I’d be free from the hell that is my life, and I was right. 12 hours of peace feels amazing, not like I’m on drugs but like a sunset. It’s so sad that because a few people in the past abused these drugs, the hundreds of thousands that could benefit from the have to suffer.",2024-04-14 02:00:09,Unknown,155,1c3bd7x,136,anxiety,Imagine a Pill,0.93
Wigginmiller,"So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It’s been several years, about 6, and while I’ll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I’m just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn’t help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I’m pretty sure he either didn’t want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn’t even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn’t do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn’t realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he’d try to change the subject. Don’t get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn’t even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn’t feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like “oh let’s smoke a bowl that’ll cheer you up!” And that was when I had my first panic attack. I’m talking full on “I’m gonna die oh my god.” This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn’t sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn’t know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I’ve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it’s caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can’t really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don’t really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he’s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I’m kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It’s hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can’t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I’d love to answer, but I’d also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I’m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don’t deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that’s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a “haha I got you” thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I’m trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven’t responded yet, I will definitely try. I’ll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously.

ThinCover1303,"
I’m M45 married to F40 for 15 months. F40 suffers from severe anxiety, depression, and constantly not feeling well. When I first met her 3 years ago, she did disclose her mental health issues. Although I had no idea how severe it could become and emotionally draining on both of us.  There is so much to divulge but I’ll keep it short to what’s important.  

Right now, she doesn’t take medications and no therapy. SHe actually wants me to find couples counseling  since we  fight ALL the time. And it’s my “duty” She does take and teach yoga and Pilate classes which seems to subside the anxiety. She does take eastern medicinal herbs, which she claims that it helps.  During courtship, I signed with better help (regain), love addicts, and church counselor.  I just recently signed up with regain but she told me to find another therapist for credential reasons. 

She would want me to watch YouTube videos on how to deal with anxious person, what to say and what not to say. There is a sense of control and her constant demand that I have to change my behaviors. She made me delete my social media apps. A game that I play and other leisure activities. 

I have learned to be more aware of how I can speak to her. Do chores around the house to ease her anxiety. I wrote the 4 steps to her calm down. Which are assurance, validation , consistency and follow through. 

There are signs of Contempt,
Resentment, and she always recounts my mistakes and what I m doing wrong.  She gets aggressive, agitated easily.  She will cry all the time and tell me she is not feeling good. Doesn’t love her self. I honestly don’t believe she is attracted to me anymore. 

The fighting are endless and she screams so loud that it hurts my ears. Regardless of time of day. If could be as early as I woke up or even right before I go to bed. It will prolong for hours without a care if I had to go to work the day of or next day.  

The neighbor had called the cops on us so many times. Even when we celebrated our 1 year anniversary on a cruise , after a night of drinking. Security had to come to the room b/c she had a breakdown. 

B/c of the multiple breakdowns she would pack her stuff and book and Airbnb. So far last year, she had done so 10 times out of the year. Leaving for 2-3
Or even 10 days.  Right now she is at Airbnb since the 20th of Jan. After a fight where
She broke our bedroom window.  Second window broken in the house.  I m now allowed to express my frustration or tell her how upset I’m since my house is being destroyed and have holes in the wall. She reply by saying that I’m blaming her and I don’t see my fault in all this.  And when I confront her with what’s causing all this, she tells that I m causing her a breakdown and I need to stop. 

There is so much to unpack and I’m running out of hope of how I can salvage this marriage.  I don’t know what to do.

DisguisedGramps,"My goal here is to provide some hope and insight for others that are experiencing anxiety by sharing my journey. Maybe I can just help one person that is seeking answers like I was. This isn't some quick fix, but simply what my experience was over years and maybe you can gather some useful info. This post is mainly for people that have just recently stumbled into anxiety, specifically after a drug related event, but it may help anyone.

**ABOUT ME:**  
I had what I like to call an “on-going panic attack” for about 2 years. It all started in my senior year of college. I had never really had “anxiety” before as I would call it now. I would certainly get nervous and anxious about exams or fears, but it was fairly minor. I would overthink stuff and have always been a bit of a hypochondriac but I would never claimed myself as an anxious person.

That was until my first panic attack. There was a lot of stressors going on my life at the time (2021)… Covid, graduating college, trying to figure out what to do with my life, dating, isolation, etc. I decided that with my time in isolation during Covid that I would try edibles to help with the tough times. I was always a bit of a goody two shoes and never did any sort of drugs, and would really only drink occasionally, but at this point I was desperate. The first few times I had a lot of fun but after some time during the year I decided to take an increased dosage as I felt as though I wasn’t really having as much fun as the first time I had done it. Went from taking a usual 10mg to then deciding to take 20mg. I started to feel extremely anxious, with an overwhelming sense of dread and fear as my whole body started freaking out. This was my first panic attack. I had been playing video games at the time and was desperate to go to the ER. Felt like I was almost in a time loop and lasted for hours and maybe at least what felt like that I can’t remember. Truly the worst experience of my entire life. Over the next few days, I still felt kinda bleh, but it was something that was in the past.

**THE INCIDENT:**  
A week goes by and I’m laying in bed on my phone, when all of a sudden I’m feeling a little anxious again until I’ve worked myself up about this feeling to end up having another panic attack. This time was even scarier for me, as I didn’t know WHY this was happening. At least before I knew it was the weed and it was something that happens to people. This panic however, didn’t go away. There was nothing that I was consciously thinking about to make me feel this way, I was just in this loop of being anxious about being anxious.

Days go by where this panic doesn’t subside, my whole body is shaking, and I’m alone in my apartment horrified. I end up going to the ER and they ended up giving me some fast acting anxiety medication. This is when I finally had found some small bit of peace. This debilitating anxiety had gone from an 10 to about at 8. I was no longer shaking but I will still incredibly overwhelmed. Eventually I ended up moving back home and my journey to get back to normal started.

Now this anxiety wouldn’t just come and go. It was NON-STOP. From waking up in the morning to going to bed at night there was not a single moment of peace, it was always there… but I couldn’t do anything about it this was just how I was now and it was driving me to intense depression. Usually at its worst in the morning, due to your high cortisol at that time, your body is sensitive to that increase.

**DESPERATE FOR A CURE:**  
Over this time I looked into all kinds of things to fix this, looking up my symptoms and finding stories on Reddit. Many of the things I read often made me feel worse, with people talking about how they got too high once and were forever changed. I was worried I was going to develop schizophrenia and start to lose my mind and be swept away into a mental hospital. THIS HOWEVER, I’ve learned sadly a little too late is something that SO MANY PEOPLE exactly think and it’s just irrational thoughts that are incredibly common.

After so much research I was convinced that  there was something wrong with my body. This anxiety isn’t due to any sort of stress, it was something wrong with my body and I just had to find some fix for it. I tried therapy, improving my gut health, exercise, meditation, allergies, journaling, blood tests, X-rays, and all kinds of other health stuff. I was so afraid that this was going to be my life forever and I really wouldn’t be able to take it much longer. Medication was my last resort.

**MEDICATION:**  
I was finally put on Buspirone (10mg?) and after weeks I felt no change. DONT LET THAT MAKE YOU LOSE HOPE. I was convinced that even medication wouldn’t be able to help me, but after adding on some other medications and increasing the dosage… it finally stopped after months of trial. This ISN'T me saying that medication fixes everything, but I just know that during my time I had seen so many posts and people talking about how it didn't work for them, so I am working to show the brighter side of things.

During this time I was unemployed and living at home, but at around this time of getting on medication I started a fun job at an Escape Room place. This job I loved, the people, the work, everything. It was truly what I needed. This in tandem with the medication helped me wake up one morning and realize that I hadn’t felt anxious in some time. After almost 2 years of constant unbearable fear, I found comfort finally. I

I ended up even finding someone at work that had gone through something similar, they had the exact same thoughts that they were going to develop schizophrenia and go crazy, but now we were both enjoying life again.

**LIFE NOW:**  
I look back now and find it so frustrating that when I was searching in fear on Reddit for someone to have lived through what I had gone through and made it out okay all I could find were horror stories. People saying that they have been like this for 15 years or something like that. THAT WAS THE WORST THING TO HEAR when trying to find hope… like what the hell guys that is not what someone needs to be thinking about. I think it was difficult to find good stories because often times we’re searching our negative symptoms and people post on here with their problems, with solutions being scarce.

**THINGS THAT HELPED ME:**

* Exercise. Running was the worst thing in the world for me, but hey it really does help even a little bit.
* Meditation. Working on trying to ground yourself when feeling especially rough.
* Sleepcasts. Helped me get to sleep and distract myself. (I love Rainday Antiques by Headspace)
* Headspace. Super awesome meditation stuff and framing anxiety. There’s an app but also a lot of free stuff on YouTube.
* Medication. Don’t give up!
* Environment. Surround yourself with people that support you and understand. No one else could even perceive what I was going through, but this doesn’t mean you’re alone. I just got a fun job and focused on living in the present for a bit.
* Therapy. Even just talking out how you feel with a family or friend. Or find someone online that is similar to you.

**CONCLUSION:**  
I think the panic was something that was coming from many stressors, but the weed was the last straw. I still do have a lot of anxiety about careers and what I’d like to do with my life, and I think that’s probably where most of the stress was as I had just graduated but was mostly subconscious. Medication and my environment helped me get to a point where I felt like myself again until I didn’t need it anymore. 

Hopefully this post can help just one person that is as lost as I once was and is searching for help. If you have similar stories or advice please share them! And if you have any questions, ask away! :)

**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for sharing! There is a lot more I could write but I wanted to say that I’m not trying to frame medication as a perfect solution. For me, it helped me get my body out of this state of debilitating anxiety, where I could then work on the things that were giving me anxiety (which at the time, I didn’t think were the problem I thought my body was just ruined because of the weed).

Also want to say that if you’re reading this post years from now, feel free to still ask any questions. I know it’s rough out there, stay strong!",2024-10-05 06:10:48,Unknown,53,1fwec6b,146,anxiety,I HAD “Permanent” Anxiety. Here’s my story and how it went away.,0.95
EfficientSine,"I gave my psychiatrist a list of  ""criterias"" I would've loved him to consider before prescribing me my first medication ever. Firstly only works on the physical symptoms and not mental, also non-addictive, and doesn't cause a light-headed dizziness. I got metoprolol. Initially this was to help me soothe my driving anxiety, which was so bad that my tremor would let me have less control of the wheel. I didn't realize how bad it was until people started pointing it out when with me as passengers. But metoprolol has increased my quality in life in multiple ways. I stopped getting palpitations and that heavy dreading feeling when thinking about future events that worry me, such as upcoming presentations and driving to difficult places.

Today I did that presentation and it went great. Fight-or-flight completely thrown into the trash. Out of years of presenting, this was the first ever to feel ""normal"". No shaking legs or arms, no heart racing, and no shortness of breathe with a shaky voice. I felt great presenting, if anything. As if I finally managed to learn how to carry the weight of the person I've been trying to be my whole life. I've read about metoprolol being a common stage fright relief so it's no wonder. ***Keep in mind, beta blockers does not affect me mentally, so it's up to me to fight the mental aspect of anxiety.*** Oh and one more thing, zero effects on my sex drive which I also found is great. I'm not sure if this is me having a revelation that I have a high blood pressure or hypertension problems, but I love metoprolol and everything it's done to me.

**Update Dec. 2024: I'm overwhelmed by the responses and responses this post has been receiving still, and I'm happy for everyone who shared their positive experiences too. I'll follow-up on my experience with metoprolol.**

For the last few years I only ever taken metoprolol for a few days before a presentation, then interview, and any event that makes me nervous, as some sort of safety net. The truth is, I never needed it or showed any anxiety in a normal every-day life. Having my first panic attack during middle school, I just learned to hold my composure together over the years. However, around this Fall, I was dealing with some tough times, dropped my healthy habits, garbage diet, you name it. Along with being overworked and feeling alone after moving out to pursue my studies, my mental health deteriorated fast and my body was showing it even faster. That's when I knew my extreme anxiety was here to stay and not just pop up during a stage fright.

At some point I raised my hand once in a workshop to answer a question, and it felt like the whole world was collapsing on me afterwards. I was a shaky mess, anchored my head down, and tried to hold myself together even though the attention was no longer on me. If anyone noticed, they'd see the side of my neck aggressively palpitating and my skin turning more red than ever as I'm overheating.

Ever since, I've been taking 50mg before any class and my body would be just fine. I'm aware that I'm missing the bigger picture of my mental health's decline and need to work on a thousand of things, but sometimes there's nothing wrong with a little help until I get my shit together. The thing about beta blockers, they're amazing because by eliminating my body's anxiety responses, I can focus on being eloquent and showing confidence as an indirect advantage. Hope this provides some more context to anyone who read this far.

Most importantly, I'm no doctor and strictly speaking on my experience and how well I'm compatible with this drug. For context, I'm a T2 diabetic, planning to get an evaluation on possibly being borderline, and have no allergies.",2021-12-13 21:27:42,Unknown,262,rfivaw,192,anxiety,Beta blockers (metoprolol) honestly changed my life.

c3p0n0,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best.",2019-11-19 10:40:29,Unknown,84,dyfwbm,1111,anxiety,Hadn’t Left the house in four years update.,1.0

CloudStrifeff777,"Hello,

I'm an Engineering professor in the same engineering program. Most of us are aware how difficult and challenging engineering degree programs can be, especially with the presence of complicated math and computation subjects.

While I rarely witness isolated issues such as this since it is common for engineering students to accept the difficulties due to the nature of the program, there were some students in the past (not handled by me but by my close colleagues) who had cases like this.

There was this frustrating incident (yes, even though it wasn't done to me, it was frustrating due to the attitude of the mother and I pitied my colleague). It was even escalated to the higher-ups by the mother because she claimed her daughter had anxieties and suicidal thoughts due to a failed grade given to her daughter by my colleague. The mother even threatened to make legal demands on the government agency that manages state-owned universities. Thankfully, in the end, the mother stopped because she was already being irrational and illogical or perhaps the higher-ups did not tolerate such attitude of hers. While we understood how she defended her daughter, it was still not right to blame my colleague for her daughter's failure if it was really the student's fault. Such parents only tolerate their children to be less matured and weaker in facing reality instead of empowering them. Thankfully, the student did not commit suicide and just retook the subject.

There was even this news just before the pandemic where a student committed suicide while attending his internship by jumping from a building and in the suicide note, one of the reasons were he was blaming his professor for not accepting his late submission. I felt sad on the student. But I also felt sad that the professor had to almost publicly apologize and regret something he didn't intend to happen. He was just doing his job after all, by implementing the standards set by the industry and the institution as well as maintaining discipline.

That's why I always try to be considerate especially in online classes, as long as considerations are reasonable as I do not let myself get abused by lazy and lying students. But I know that no matter what, my considerations will always be limited and I always tell it to my students I just hope they understand. I'm still assigned to handle students in an online-learning setup and I feel a little bit nervous in case this happens to me which I really hope not.

I always talk to them seriously about things in real life that I hope they understand so that they won't associate subject failures to hopelessness. I want them to know that I'm inclusive and I listen, but I cannot also give considerations forever, and these considerations I give are limited as I also need to perform my job and make sure the students I'm passing are real performers.

But I'm not a psychologist so sometimes, I'm also afraid to say some things that may be perceived insensitive by some.

Finally, to say my intentions why I posted this, for those who have overcome anxieties and depression, especially students, teachers, or professors who had depression in the past related to this matter,

(1) How did you handle them?

(2) For students who had depression, how did you accept a failed grade from a subject that you think based on your perspective, you really worked hard for?

(3) For experienced teachers or professors, how did you clarify to your depressed or anxious students that the considerations you can give are limited? Or in case of a failed depressed student, that you cannot really pass him in your subject?

(4) For psychologists that are here in this reddit community, what is your advice to an educator like me in case I personally encounter such situation?

It makes me frustrated whenever I encounter students who are very entitled of themselves, thinking we need to fulfill their dreams for them without difficulties just because it is their dreams, and when they face difficulties, they suddenly turn anxious. While I do not invalidate any form of anxiety or depression, how can we, as educators, change these kids' mentality so that they would accept the reality better?

I always tell them that all the difficulties they experience on my subject as well as to the whole engineering program is due to the real demand and standards of the industry, that we, as a college institution, must prepare them to make sure those who would finish the degree will be capable of handling the real-life pressure brought by the industry, that they will be effective and matured professionals in their respective profession. And this is something that is beyond our control as we really need a competitive and innovative atmosphere in different industries in order to sustain their reliability to our society.

I'm sorry for a long post but I appreciate you for reading my post. May God bless you and give you a peaceful life full of happiness.",2022-03-03 01:40:51,Unknown,34,t58zpy,15,mentalhealth,"URGENT.

okayyynutella,"Sorry in advance if the post is really long.

I got this email from my mother 2 days ago. I found it before I got in bed last night, and I’ve been awake ever since. (It’s 6am in NZ)

I lived with this woman my whole life, enduring physical assaults and emotional abuse for years as a child. At 16, I had a restraining order against her and went to live full-time with my grandparents until I moved out of town as a young adult. I cut her off completely

Since becoming an adult and making my own life, I allowed her back into my life slowly and with a lot of boundaries, in hopes of being able to finally push her to get the help she’s always needed. It wasn’t easy, there have been many situations where I should’ve cut her off for good, but I was scared if I didn’t keep her happy then she would take it out on my siblings.

In the end, she chose not to get help, the abuse got really bad again and she started sending me horrible messages again, so at the end of last year I finally blocked her again.

Now, I’m 28 years old, I own my own home with my fiancé (who is amazing), I’m excelling in my career, yet I’m broken. I just can’t take it anymore, I just want her out of my life for good so I can focus on my own life as I prepare to marry my partner and start a family of our own, but with every nasty text, email or message, I just shatter more and more. I’m scared to become a mother and I end up just like her.

Over the last 12 years of this, I’ve dealt with NZ Police, Child Welfare services, Hospitals & Mental Health services. I have over ten years worth of screenshots of horrible messages she sent me, everything has been reported and nothing has happened because she’s “not threatening”, but someone out there has to agree that this is NOT OKAY to send someone and REGARDLESS of anyone’s mental health situation, behaviour like this has to be held accountable. Am I just supposed to ignore it and pretend it doesn’t affect me anymore? I’m at my wits end. I’m depressed, I feel hopeless, I don’t know what to do.

Please someone just tell me what to do to end this for good (besides obviously getting therapy. I’ve been through therapy and counselling before, but I can’t afford it right now so it’s not an option for me). Or even if you can give me some insight, maybe you’ve dealt with something similar?  Unfortunately the adults in my life are not giving me the proper support or advise that I need right now, I just want a proper “adult” to tell me what to do please. 😔💔",2025-03-06 22:56:33,Unknown,54,1j50tg6,162,mentalhealth,My mother has been trying to break me my entire life,0.98
Wildlifefr6,"Edit: I made another post asking a more in depth question on this subreddit! I would love for all of you to go and comment on there.

here is a question you could answer if you don’t have anything off the top of your head 

Do you feel like you are living up to your full potential? Why or why not? 

I want to know what people in their 20’s like me struggle with the most right now. Whether that is mental health, finances, school, career, purpose, etc. I want to know the gory details and hopefully create a safe place for everyone to get answers/advice and feel less alone. I have many struggles of my own such as anxiety, depression, adhd, history of self harm, history of alcohol abuse, CPTSD, and the list goes on and on. Also I know people say that your 20s are the time of your life but I’ve also heard people say that’s a lie. I’m starting a podcast and I want to help people out there struggling to feel less alone. This is not me asking for anyone to listen to my podcast. I genuinely want to help and see if anyone has something they wanna get off there chest! Stories and advice you would like me to mention are always welcome too. This is 100% about helping others and if you have a message to share I would love to hear it. Thank you so much

Update: I am trying to go thru everyone’s comment and get back to you.

smikketabito,"To expand on that idea a bit more one could ask whether or not once the underlying depression/anxiety is properly treated without the constant use of marijuana whether or not this person would be dependent on the substance and therefore suffer equally from an addiction problem. 

The real cause for concern is misdiagnosis and administration of the wrong techniques for treatment. I understand that in this day and age people assume that we have everything like that figured out but mind you, laughing gas was used solely as a recreational drug for more than 100 years until a dentist saw a man hurt his leg while high on it and realized it was an anesthetic.

Aggressive-Slice-179,"I’m 23, and I always thought my mental health struggles were just a result of entering adulthood—more responsibilities, transitioning from student life, trying to figure out who I am, etc. But lately, I’ve been noticing something deeper going on—not just with me, but with everyone around me.

I keep reading about 15 and 16-year-olds suffering from brain fog, anxiety, depression, even suicidal thoughts. That terrifies me. These are kids. What’s happening to us?

Is it really just social media messing with our brains? Is it COVID and the long-term psychological or even physical effects? Is it the state of the world—economically, socially, environmentally? Or are we just becoming more aware of mental health issues that always existed?

I know part of it is the overwhelming amount of technology in our lives—how it’s created this weird paradox where we’re constantly connected but feel more isolated than ever. It’s like we’re surrounded by people online but starved for real connection in real life.

I mean, I’m sure if you were living 200 years ago, these things didn’t exist, right? Or at least not at this scale. People weren’t constantly anxious, mentally burnt out, or numb at 16. What the hell is going on?

I don’t know. It just feels like something is off with this entire generation. Like we’re all slowly slipping. I’d love to hear your thoughts—do you feel the same? Do you think there’s a bigger reason behind this mental health crisis?

Therearefour-lights,"I've been with this same mental health clinic for almost 10 years. And for most of those years, I've seen a therapist and a psychiatrist/nurse practitioner to prescribe/monitor medication. For the last year or so, I've felt like I have reached a point where I no longer need therapy. I have been taking the same meds for years and my issues I feel like are now in a good place as long as I at least have my meds. They regularly drug test me and I have never failed, nor have I had any substance abuse issues in the past.

They require you to be active in therapy in order to receive medication. Since I have not been active for awhile in therapy (but continued my medication appointments), today they threatened to close my case entirely and cut me off if I do not make a therapist appointment tomorrow. Should I try to reason with them (look, I've been with you guys for almost 10 years, I feel like im in a good place now and do not need therapy at this time. But cutting off my meds would cause a considerable issue, is there any way you can make an exception for me?)

 Is this policy common across most mental health clinics? Because I would just switch to another, but if I'm going to have a really hard time finding one that will just provide me with medication management and I might have to bite the bullet and waste my time talking to a therapist?

sleepyncaffeinated,"I would have posted this in r/AskReddit but I couldn't write more than the title.

Basically... why? I know a few people with BPD, and one of them (ex friend) used it as an excuse for shitty behavior like cancelling plans she insisted in make with me, with no regard of my time (I had a job and little free time) and no *""I'm sorry for being such an asshole""*. To be fair most people I know with BPD are working towards self-improvement and being functional beings of society, but in the case of that girl, she used it as an excuse AND also her mother, who stopped talking to me because ""she understand what her daughter has, and she loves her the way she is"" (basically spoiling her).

But on the other hand, narcissism is an accusatory term. r/raisedbynarcissists or r/NarcissisticAbuse for example. But both narcissism and BPD are clinical terms, they are cluster B diagnosis. But **no one would say** ***""You have to empathise with me and excuse me for my behavior, I have narcissistic personality disorder""*****.** But many people with BPD say this. As if people with BPD can't control their actions but narcissistics are machiavelic or something.

If I tell you the issue with that former friend without mentioning her disorder, many will tell me *""She is a narcissist! Screw her!""*. But if I mention she has BPD, so so so many people from TikTok and self-diagnosed with some disorder will say *""You gotta understand her, she has a disorder that messes up her personality, you have to support her, she doesn't want to be like this""*. WHY? Narcissism is still a disorder (not just being evil). BPD still has awful consequences on the mental and emotional health of your close people. **Just because you have a diagnosed mental disorder doesn't mean you can get away with being insensitive and emotionally irresponsible:** others have their feelings, their problems and even their mental disorders (hello, depression and anxiety!).

TL;DR: narcissism is a disorder that requires treatment (not just being evil), and BPD is not an excuse for shitty behavior and getting away with it.",2025-04-05 16:48:24,Unknown,20,1js16z6,9,mentalhealth,"Why is BPD excusatory, but narcissism is accusatory?",0.77
Divest0911,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)

Traditional-Market85,"I understand there's a lot of stigma surrounding benzodiazepines, and I've mentioned this several times before. But here's the truth, some of us genuinely need them, just like others require insulin or beta blockers for conditions like high blood pressure.

If you're like me and have tried everything, therapy, supplements, lifestyle adjustments, for years and are still trapped in your room by debilitating anxiety, stop waiting. Seek out medication and start living your life right now, today!

Your time is now! You deserve to live in the moment.

Would you rather spend the next 20, 40, or more years bedridden just because most people are against medication?

It's strange, people accept smoking weed or drinking alcohol in excess, but the moment you take a benzo, it's considered wrong. That's unfair!

Like benzos, weed and alcohol have long-term effects. Everything does! Even the water you drink and the air you breathe contain harmful substances.

If you're constantly worrying about what will happen in 20 or 40 years, you may never truly enjoy your life.

In my family, my mom and several others have been on benzos and SSRIs for 40+ years, and they’re in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s now, completely healthy because they've never abused them.

If you need benzos every day to live a fulfilling life, go for it! Just be mindful not to misuse them.

If SSRIs are what you need, take them. Life is unpredictable, you might have a few years or several decades left, so why waste time feeling nauseous, overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts, and depressed, stuck at home?

You can live a normal life, get a job, or pursue an education. Do whatever it takes to feel better, without worrying about what others think, and focus solely on the present.

I hope everyone reading this feels better soon, just like I have since accepting that I need medication. I’m not concerned about side effects that may or may not show up in 30 or 40 years. I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

For now, I'm choosing to live my life fully, happy and functional, rather than spend decades in isolation, suffering, just because society stigmatizes medication.",2024-10-23 12:04:21,Unknown,31,1ga3zpu,45,mentalhealth,Don't be Afraid to take medication if you need it.

# Howdy!

As some members have pointed out; June is Men's Mental Health Month!  
Yes, it's also pride month this month. And for those who are wondering when the Women's Mental Health Months was, that is in May (may vary per country).  



**Why is discussing Men's Mental Health so important?**    
Mental disorders affect men and women. The prevalence of several mental disorders is lower in men than in women. However, other disorders are diagnosed at comparable rates for men and women or at higher rates for men, like [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#part_2549). Men are also more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db330.htm).

Certain symptoms may also be more common in men than women, and the course of illness can be affected by a person’s sex. Researchers are only now beginning to tease apart the various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact mental health.

Men are less likely to have received mental health treatment than women in the past year. Recognizing the signs that you or someone you love may have a mental disorder is the first step toward getting treatment. The earlier that treatment begins, the more effective it can be.

But mainly, and that is what we have been seeing here on r/mentalhealth a lot: people assume that men don't struggle simply because **they are often portrayed, or expected, to be strong and silent**. This expectation is rooted in toxic masculinity and has resulted in poor mental health outcomes for men.



https://preview.redd.it/ft787mdkqb5d1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=149a484e1ba75ac2136dbdf6c81a3f4b558601d6

A [research](https://www.priorygroup.com/blog/40-of-men-wont-talk-to-anyone-about-their-mental-health#:~:text=77%25%20of%20men%20polled%20have,negative%20stigma%22%20on%20the%20issue) has shown that: 

* **77% of men** polled have suffered with symptoms of common mental health conditions such as anxiety, stress or depression.
* **40% of men have never spoken to anyone about their mental health.**
* **29%** of those say they are ""too embarrassed"" to speak about it, while 20% say there is a ""negative stigma"" on the issue.
* **40% of men** polled said it would take thoughts of suicide or self-harm to compel them to get professional help.  

    
That last one is alarming, this means that the majority of men will not seek professional help when they struggle with suicidal or self harm thoughts! Men don't talk about their issues and often think: 'I’ve learnt to deal with it', 'I don’t wish to be a burden to anyone' or ‘I have no-one to talk to’. We hope r/mentalhealth will offer you a safe place where you anonymously can share your story. While we are on the topic of being anonymous, it is totally okay to create a new Reddit account and post here on that alt account!

77% of men polled said they experienced some level of symptoms for common mental health problems such as anxiety, stress or depression.

But what underlying factors are driving those symptoms? Respondents were asked about the biggest causes of pressure in their life - pressures that might negatively impact their mental health.

The top three issues were:

* Work-related pressure - 32%
* Financial pressures at - 31%
* Health concerns - 23%

Is this something you recognize?

So what is? As with all complex healthcare issues, there is no easy answer when it comes to redressing the disparities in access to formal support for people of color and those from other diverse ethnic backgrounds. Nevertheless, where there is a will, there is a way!

You might feel that they won't listen or are able to understand. Or you might struggling to put into words how you feel.

thegreat-annihilator,"Hello, I'm an autistic 20 year old with dysthymia and OCD. I struggle with social isolation, poor self-esteem, not feeling connected to others, intense social anxiety, childhood/adolescent trauma (and all the bitterness and cynicism that comes with those things), chronic depression and suicidality, and honestly quite a lot of other problems. I cannot afford therapy, but I'm really struggling to see the value in my own life or find any compelling reasons to continue it in spite of the fact that I have suffered and do suffer for most of it.

So I think I'll have to find the bulk of my support here on Reddit. That being said, I could really use some advice for how to actually make progress this way—tips regarding subjects like:

* **How to format posts that will actually get responses on mental health subreddits** (not this one specifically)
* **How to keep posts at a reasonable length while providing sufficient context** (many of my problems are really complex and feed into each other, and it would take an *enormous* amount of text to really explain all of it, but obviously people on the internet aren't going to read my entire autobiography)
* **How to differentiate between good advice and bad advice in the comments**
* **What subreddits are actually worth trying** (for example, there's like 5 different depression subreddits and I'm not sure which is the best to use; there are also subreddits like r/selfimprovement and r/getdisciplined, but they seem bent towards increasing productivity; I don't want to be productive, I want to be happy.)
* **How to talk about my feelings with other people in a way that is productive**
* **How to explain my feelings**
* **Any advice or encouragement from people who have walked this same path and have succeeded, if you're really out there**
* **Any advice at all**

GloriousLego,"Hello Guys,  
I need help: My Girlfriends mental health is delcining again. She has Depression and BPD. The biggest trigger for her BPD are her parents. They are also the reason for her Depression.  And she's been diagnosed with depression since she's 12. They are also often the reason why she wants to take her own life. And the problem is, that she tells me something is bad or that she acts completely cold towards me. Then I ask her what's wrong and how I can help her and reassure her. Then she often doesn't read my messages and then afterwards tells me she's sorry because she cut herself again. Another one of her coping mechanisms is smoking. She says she isn't addicted, but she smokes often. And I've known so many people, that got destroyed because they smoked. So I want to get her away from smoking. The third thing she does when she has like an overwhelming experience and she can't cut herself or smoke is that she destroys so much in her home or that she calls everyone slurs and stuff. But I want to help her get over this. And like help her. She can't move out from her parents, because she has no one in her area that could take her in. And when she tries to defend herself, because sometimes she gets beaten by her parents, it only gets worse. And I just want to know: how can I help her with her Depression and control her BPD? Since her parents are the biggest trigger, because they are very toxic and very jealous, I'm overwhelmed and don't know how to help her. She takes very strong medication already and is going to therapy. But she says that her medication doesn't help her very much right now. How can I help her?   
Thank you for your advice. ",2024-09-30 23:24:16,Unknown,31,1ft1x72,36,mentalhealth,My girlfriends mental health is getting worse,0.94

mn_2577,"My Husband has struggled with his emotional health for years - severe anxiety took over his life as the years went on. His alcohol consumption got out of control, then he layered that with medical weed. He just became miserable. Withdrawn and began saying he hated everything he loved just days before. The house, the dogs, me...   Didn't want to leave the house unless it was to go to a bar or smoke. Then one day he snapped, eyes went black and he walked out with the clothes on his back. He abandoned me and our son. And its taken a year for his family to finally start to see there truly is an issue! He is on a downward spiral, alienating his kids which were the center of his universe, and is living a lifestyle he once despised in others.  I do believe there is underlying mental health issues here as well. He is incredibly hostile, forgetful, questions why 'everyone' hates him and truly doesn't seem to have concept of time, no self awareness. This loving selfless man is now a narcissist and it makes no sense. 

Is this the true path of what alcoholism and addiction looks like? Is rock bottom the only way for them to have realization? I've exhausted everything I have to try and help but he doesn't want it because he sees nothing wrong because he is in denial. 

I love my Husband. My son loves his father. Is this hopeless? Do people ever come out of this on their own? Is there anything that can be suggested from those that have gone through this?

Gildedbrush,"I’m nearly a daily drinker and a semi heavy one at that. I also have depression. I’ve been the most depressed I’ve ever been in my entire life since the pandemy. I take lexapro to manage depression. Drinking also causes me to binge eat and I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been which is another cause of my poor mental health. I know the alcohol is making it worse, especially being on lexapro.  I’m at such an intense breaking point I’m genuinely scared for myself. 

But what scares me more? Quitting drinking. How do I stop doing something I enjoy doing so much? I like beer, I like the way alcohol makes me feel. My husband and I love going to breweries. But I know for an absolute fact this is killing me. I can’t keep consuming alcohol anymore. It’s a comfort to me, it relaxes me, it makes me happy and bubbly and floaty, especially in social situations or in crowds where I struggle with anxiety and claustrophobia. 

I am just so scared. For myself. For my husband and our future together. I don’t want to leave this earth but there are days where I think about it and plan the details. I can’t talk about this to other people in my life without feeling shame or like I’m a burden. 

I need help. I most definitely need therapy, but I am struggling with the motivation and will to actually find one that I can afford or that takes my insurance. So here I am looking for some solace or commaradere or advice or someone to tell me to quite the bullshit. I have to talk about it in some way.

TopProfessional8023,"I’ve (45M) been drinking on average a pint of distilled alcohol (vodka or whiskey) 4-5 days a week for almost 10 years. I was a heavy binge drinker for 10 years before that, but I at least took time off here and there when binging…I’ve always drank a lot of water for what that’s worth? You should be doing that regardless!!!

Shockingly, I have thus far only experienced relatively minor digestive inflammation issues and some slightly elevated liver enzyme levels that dropped significantly when I took a month off and changed my diet. In other words, for whatever reason MY genes have thus far SEEMINGLY protected me from major physical damage. 

But, my marriage failed (she drank a lot too) As did the next relationship I was in (She drank a lot too. Seeing a pattern?) I haven’t pursued interests or career with the vigor I should have. I’ve let my house go to shit, neglected things that needed attention because I thought I’d have a drink or two and THEN take on that project…NAH! Just drink more.

That being said, the slow and steady weight gain, the acid reflux that I’m beginning to experience, my bloated face…all that aside…I’m tired. I sleep like shit most of the time. I’m tired of being subservient to a substance. I’m tired of wasting my money on something that makes me feel good for an hour and then I have to keep doing it to not feel like shit. 

Not to mention, all of this could just catch up to me at some point! Just because I’m relatively ok now doesn’t mean a few years from now I will be ok. And the long term mental effects are not something you can quantify until it’s too late. Also, not something people talk about a lot. It’s always just liver, kidney, stomach…

My mother was a mental health social worker for 45 years and the number of patients (some as young as early 30’s) who had alcohol-induced dementia was shocking to her. She always warned me and I didn’t listen…because I was born an addict. Not because of anything my parents did. It was in that same dna I just mentioned a few paragraphs ago. And in the sexual and physical trauma I experienced as a child. I was destined for this battle against trauma and alcohol was my mate.

I’m not saying alcohol should be outlawed. We tried that. Didn’t work very well. But, the casual approach we take to alcohol as a society is killing so many people. Cigarettes are gross. We all get that now (I still like having a heater or two..:addict! Did you read above?!) But, in my mind alcohol is the most insidious, deceitful and destructive substance on the planet outside of maybe opiates in general.

My hope here is that any younger folks reading this will think twice before they get habituated to boozing every weekend at college or whatever…or thinking it’s ok cos it’s legal. First of all. That’s self-medication talk. Seek out therapy NOW! Don’t wait until you’re 45! Trust us ‘old’ folks!!!!

I will end this with a story of sorts. When I was 19 I worked in a restaurant. There was a guy who would buy be a six-pack of Killian’s Irish Red beer.::I drank a six pack a night for months on end…loved how it made me feel. But, I stopped myself at 19 and acknowledged that I might have a problem. I didn’t drink alcohol for nearly 2 years…until my 21st birthday. It’s been downhill ever since.

IF you’re ’new to this’ and feel like you might have a problem controlling your drinking, stop NOW. Don’t let yourself get to where we are. I beg you. Trust me. Believe me. ",2025-03-24 23:30:43,Unknown,13,1jix7ee,83,alcoholism,General thoughts on my 20+years of heavy drinking,0.97
ceeewow,"I don't know what to do anymore. I'm at the end of my rope.

My 40 year old brother is a SEVERE alcoholic. 

There is a lonnnnnng history, I won't get into.. but basically since my mom passed away 4 years ago, my brother has turned back to alcohol and it's gotten so bad, I genuinely think he is going to die.

I also became an alcoholic and severely depressed after my mom passed, until about 2 years ago. I found out I was pregnant with my first child and quit everything cold turkey. Getting pregnant literally saved my life.

Unfortunately, my brother has just progressively gotten worse and worse.

We tried therapy for him, it didn't work. He hated it and refused to take the medication/guidance of his therapist.
He tried AA, he went 1 time and hated it because he said it was too focused around religion for him, and he's not religious.
We tried rehab for 30 days - he went willingly and actually did really well (so we thought). He ended up being sober for 100+ days before all of sudden drinking again. (He doesn't have insurance anymore, but even with insurance, rehab put him 40k in debt)

Before my mom died, my sister and him rented a house together. After she passed, my sister moved into my mom's place and she continues to sign the lease with my brother every year so he can continue to live there alone. He has 2 cats, my sister now has my mom's 2 dogs, him moving in with her with his 2 cats is not an option. My sister constantly helps him with rent and gives him money in general when he needs it.

He lost his job. Found a new job and worked there 3 weeks before quitting. So he's now jobless again.


Every time he gets drunk, he sends suicidal messages to anyone that will listen. Siblings, old co workers, distant family, old friends from high-school, anyone and everyone. I get messages on Facebook from strangers all the time telling me they've been talking to my brother and begging me to help him. 

He ONLY does this when he's drunk. When he's sober, he's fairly normal and pleasant to be around.


Yesterday, I tried getting in contact with him all day and couldn't. So I showed up to his house around 9pm to find him so drunk he could hardly function. He didn't know what day it was, told me he hasn't eaten in days and hasn't showered in 2 weeks. He lost his phone and its dead. His house is completely trashed and filthy (it was the same way before he went to rehab. Me, my fiance, my sister, and little brother spent a week cleaning his house from top to bottom so he could come home to clean house and fresh start after rehab)

His kitchen is unusable, I couldn't cook him anything. I tried to get him to eat bread, he refused. I tried to get him to drink water, he refused. He just kept apologizing to me, telling me he wants to die over and over again. After going back and forth with him for about an hour, he told me he just wanted to sleep. I tried looking for his phone, but couldn't find it. I told him to get sleep. I told him when he woke up sober, to take a shower and look for his phone. If I didn't hear from him by noon, I would come back around 1 to pick him up and bring him back to my house to spend time with my daughter (his niece, she's 15months). I would cook him lunch and dinner and we could talk about what we are going to do to help him, because he can't continue like this. He agreed. I left. Barely got any sleep because I stayed up all night worrying about him.

Today, I went to his house at 1pm to find him completely shit faced AGAIN. Didnt remember anything about me being there last night. I asked him if he slept, he said yes, but started drinking again as soon as he woke up. I found another empty bottle of vodka that wasnt there last night and a solo cup of vodka/sprite on his table that I dumped out. He thanked me for dumping it out. I asked him if he had any more liquor and he said he didn't know. I tried looking around, but could only find empty bottles in all the clutter and trash.

He still hasn't eaten. I tried to get him to get in my car and come to my house, but he refused. Just kept saying he wanted to sleep. Kept saying he felt like he was gonna throw up and just wanted to die. I tried to get him to go to the bathroom, he refused. Tried to get him to eat bread AGAIN, he refused. I did finally get him to take a few sips of water. He looked so bad and frail, I felt like I needed to take him to the hospital. He refused. After another hour of dealing with him, trying to find his phone, and him refusing everything I tried to help him with, I ended up agreeing to just let him try to sleep it off again. I found a bowl that I put next to the couch in case he needed to puke, gave him another bottle of water,  took his wallet and his cash, and left. I told him I would be back tonight to check on him and to bring him to my house.

I truly don't know what to do anymore. I have a 15month old daughter and a fiance that thinks we baby him too much. My fiance keeps saying we need to give him ""tough love"" and cut him off from everything.  My sister swears she's not signing the lease anymore, that she doesn't care if he ends up on the streets.

I feel so bad for him. I understand the frustration because I feel it too, but I don't want him on the streets and i definitely dont want him to die. (I feel like if my sister cuts him off, he will just unalive himself.) I hate that he's so depressed and lonely and suicidal and I can't help him. The only thing I can think of is bringing him to my house and letting him stay here for awhile (we live close to eachother) and when he's sober, helping him clean his house. But I know when he goes back to living by himself, he will do the same shit.

He literally says NO to everything. Anything we suggest he just shoots down. I don't know what to do other than have my fiance physically drag him out of the house (which is our plan tonight if he refuses to come willingly) but I also have my daughter I have to think about, so this is not a long time solution for us. (I'm mainly worried about how he will be while going through withdrawal at my house.. I really don't know what to expect nor do I want it around my daughter)

There is so much more I could explain, but this is pretty much the gist of it all. I'm going back tonight to check on him and try to get him to my house, but I'm honestly terrified he's going to be dead so I'm scared to go. I feel so guilty for leaving him alone again today (I'm hoping he is just sleeping it off). My fiance is so insensitive and heartless about the whole situation, he doesn't understand why I'm so upset about it all and why we don't just ""treat him like a man"" and force him to shape up. 

I have my own depression and health issues I'm dealing with and the stress of everything going on with my brother just feels unbearable. I cry every day over him...

I'll take any ideas or advice on how to deal with him. I'm willing to answer any further questions if anybody has any.
We live in Nevada if anybody is knowledgeable about what we can do for help. He doesn't have insurance anymore, so I feel like there are not many options.

My sister has pretty much started to give up on him, so I feel like I'm now having to take over full responsibility on how to deal with him... 

Please no rude comments as I simply don't think I can handle them :( 

Thank you for reading <3

Ashamed-Manager7552,"Let’s stop normalizing ""social drinking”as if it’s benign and harmless. Social drinking can cause alcohol related deaths by disease, spousal abuse or drunk driving. Social drinking can destroy marriages and families. Social drinking can cause violence and harm to innocent bystanders. There is nothing normal about drinking a poison that impairs judgment and self-control, increases impulsiveness and recklessness. I've never seen alcohol bring out the best in anyone. I dont have to run down the list of obnoxious behaviors that it brings out of people, we've all been there and we've all witnessed it in others way too many times. Just because someone only drinks socially, doesn't mean they are not dependent on the drug. They need it to function in a social setting. Without it they can't have fun, or be comfortable in their own skin.  That's a classic sign of addiction, there are many levels of it. Let's stop justifying and normalizing drug addiction just because it's only done ""socially"". Most drug users prefer to be around their own kind. If you enjoy being around your drunken friends and family go for it. I personally find it very boring but that’s just me.

How alcohol affects your looks



As well as the beer belly and drinker’s nose, alcohol can affect your looks in other ways.



Dry wrinkled skin



Alcohol causes your body and skin to lose fluid (dehydrate).



Dry skin wrinkles more quickly and can look dull and grey.



Alcohol’s diuretic (water-loss) effect also causes you to lose vitamins and nutrients. For example, vitamin A. This is important for skin health.



Skin problems



Alcohol can cause the skin condition rosacea to flare up.



Symptoms of rosacea include:



redness

dilated blood vessels

small red bumps

pus-filled spots on the face

It can also cause broken blood vessels and redness on your face. 90% of patients with rosacea who cut back on alcohol say it helps to reduce flare-ups.



Bloating



Alcohol can cause water retention in your face. This makes your face look bloated and puffy.



Bloodshot eyes



Alcohol can irritate the blood vessels on the surface of your eyes, making them bloodshot.



Dry, thinning hair



Alcohol dries your hair as well as your skin, making it more likely to break and split.



Smell



People who have been drinking can smell bad. The liver breaks down most of the alcohol you drink so that it can be removed from the body. But some alcohol leaves the body through your breath, sweat and urine.

dunnie31,"The first time I drank more than a couple sips of a beer was when I was a college freshman trying to fit in. I was against it all through high school, didn’t really like it the first few times I tried it, and I still stayed away from drinking heavily until I was 21. And even then, I barely drank in college. My dad’s side of the family (and some of my mom’s) was full of alcoholics and drug addicts, and I just never thought “it’d happen to me” because I avoided many of those family members (which I feel was the right thing in some regard, and something I regret in other regards).

So when I started binge drinking many years later at 30 years old because of a number of reasons, mainly depression from sudden job loss as the catalyst, I started thinking “oh shit, was I doomed from the start? Surely I’m hopeless from unemployment, but was I worse off from my family history?”

The truth is, I was always addicted to something since I was 12. I struggled with having (nice, supportive) friends, my self-esteem and confidence was shit, I was depressed, and I started watching porn at a young age. That was my comfort for many years. I became so used to my depression and always felt like there was a rain cloud in the distance ready to fuck up any happy day/progress I was making. I settled in and got cozy to the bad times. I thought it was meant to build character (and to a degree I still believe this). Somehow I made it through college with no antidepressants, getting crazy drunk, or going off the deep end. But not long later, I started smoking weed every day and had a very hard time quitting (currently approaching three years off of it). Then I moved onto alcohol and have been in recovery for a year and a half with quite a few relapses under my belt.

I keep asking myself, despite the good stuff in my life (wife/family/friends/pets, job, home, hobbies), why the fuck I was (and sometimes continue) self-sabotaging. Writing all of this, I know my addiction was my fault, but I know there was something at every step that, internally, encouraged me to use whatever substance I was glued to. And maybe to some level, genetics were involved. But I’m not entirely sure about that. I’m coming up on two months sober from alcohol and I guess I just gotta keep searching for the answers. 

So, as far as your relationship with alcohol, what do you think influenced its role in your life?",2024-11-20 00:54:45,Unknown,38,1gv5jdy,12,alcoholism,Do you think your alcoholism stems from genetics/upbringing or self-sabotage?,1.0
Ok-Work-5438,"I've been dealing with my husbands drinking and all of the effects of his drinking. Passing out all day for years. Cheating. Lying. Gaslighting. Neglect. Asshole behavior. Verbal physical abuse. Blacking out and never remembering anything. Our daughter being neglected. Financial neglect. Just an awful toxic circle off the same things everyday for years. Like dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde behavior. Id take care of our kid all day and put her to bed and want to cuddle or have sex and he'd be passed out. Day after day for years. I'd be so confused, we could never talk because he's in a different world entirely and his perspective is all fucked and he's never in reality to me. Daily drinking a 5th each day. He works and is high earning but it feels like we're poor because his spending habits are alcohol and bullshit. All of this affects our child and me. So many days of no hugs no apology no affection, no empathy. All he sees now is that I criticize him and get angry and say mean things. He doesn't see how I'm existing on the other end. How I'm still caring for our child and building memories for her while he's passed out. How I'm always seeing what he needs or trying to initiate affection. How I just want the basics of love trust consideration and stability. He can't see how I'm angry for good reason. I'm not just criticizing him, I'm hoping he can hear my words and adjust and change or communicate something so I understand. I just figured he was tired from work and depressed and that's why he was always passing out. I didn't understand the mood swings. I knew he was a heavy drinker I just didn't understand the effects of alcohol and that he was addicted. It took me 2+ years to realize that's what was happening. I thought he was a narcissist or maybe have personality disorder. We'd get counseling and he would drink before or during our sessions. He's finally been able to go days at a time without it and maybe a couple months at one point last summer. But then he started hiding it. Now he's stopped again for the last few days. Last week he was watching our daughter so he made an excuse to leave and sat in the parked car with our 3yo daughter and drank an entire bottle and pack of beer for an hour then came inside and passed out.

Alcohol causes inflammation (which leads to myriad other health issues), dehydrates, disrupts our blood sugar balance (which makes us mood swing, binge eat, get the shakes, disrupts sleep), gunks up our liver (which means our body can't detox and also means we have trouble losing weight - toxins live in fat cells), interferes with the metabolism of nutrients (absorption), replaces healthy calories (malnutrition), changes our pH balance (causing body odor), leads to loss of sleep (which leads to a host of other things that make us look like shit), disrupts the endocrine/glandular system (as in, adrenals/energy, sex hormones/periods/sex drive, sleep cycle), accelerates the aging process, worsens skin issues (like acne), causes bloating, brittles hair, causes memory loss, shrinks gray matter, induces or worsens depressive states, causes broken capillaries/rosacea, leads to other unhealthy and/or risky behavior (like poor food choices, unprotected sex, smoking), is directly linked to certain cancers (like breast cancer). There's also that whole other part about how it addicts us, kills 1 in 10 of us, robs us of years off our lives, our dignity, our freedom, our loved ones and on and on. But it’s glorification and the abuse continues. ",2024-11-01 14:53:28,The,13,1gh1cy3,170,alcoholism,"YES, ALCOHOL MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT",0.95
ForumLurker92,"Me (32F) and my husband (33M) have only been married for a year and a half, most of that long distance due to work.  He's really been struggling with his mental health for the last two years, and has been having problematic behavior with alcohol and cannabis for the last year. Multiple doctors and psychiatrists have told him that he should abstain from both, and that he has a substance use disorder.

Four months ago I told him that his continued alcohol use was really bothering me- that it made him more distant and emotionally unavailable and was eroding our relationship. I also shared that having alcoholism in my family as I grew up was really painful for me, and that this topic was really important to me.

He said that he would stop drinking. In the past he would try for a week or two after a doctor brought it up, but it didn't last very long.

He did such a good job from August until November. I could see an improvement in his mental health, and a spark came back to into his eyes. He drank a lot of non-alcoholic beer on a daily basis, but he stayed sober for months. 

Then when I was away for work he had a mid-week mental breakdown. He didn't show up to work for two days, and he fell off the wagon. I found out because his boss called me.

I was understanding and supportive, and told him that everyone slips up sometimes, and told him how proud I was of him for being sober for so long. He said that he had done it once and he would be able to do it again. And he did abstain immediately after, and for another month or so.

Then in early to mid December, he told me that he was going to drink that night. I asked him why he felt the need to drink, and said I thought that he had been doing so well lately. I told him that I didn't think it was a good idea, and his doctors didn't think it was a good idea, and that it was not going to be good for his mental health. He said that he didn't see any problem with having a drink ""once in a while"" because ""he just wanted to relax."" I disagreed, but I told him that I couldn't control his actions and he would have to decide for himself.

About a week later he told me that his doctor referred him to addictions medicine, and that in the new year he would be getting a month off work to do a a daily outpatient program. I was excited about that, and happy that he thought it was a good idea as well.

A few days after that he told me that he was going to drink ""for one last time,"" before starting the addictions program and saying goodbye to alcohol forever. Again I disapproved, but told him it was his own choice. I asked if he was going to drink over the holidays, and he said no.

When we visited my family for the holidays, he had just a couple drinks here and there because my family kept offering him alcohol. 

Now we've been home for a few days. Yesterday he started drinking a couple of beers. I didn't want to be around him when he was drinking so I admittedly avoided him and spent the rest of the evening in another room of the house. Over the rest of the night he had the equivalent of 12 oz of alcohol. When I came to bed I could smell alcohol in the air and told him that I was going to sleep on the couch because I was upset about him drinking.

In the morning neither of us brought it up. We both tend to be avoidant people which I'm sure is not healthy. He went to visit his aunt during the day and I told him I wasn't going because I still have a cold, which is true, but I also didn't want to socialize with him and his family when I was still mad at him. 

He was gone for most of the day which is unlike him- he usually only spends about 2 hours socializing before he's worn out. I started getting worried about him and thought about all the times I got calls from the ER from him (for his mental health, half of the time substance-fueled). When he got home I gave him a big hug and it felt like everything was okay.

But then half an hour later he started drinking again. I asked him if he had given up on trying to be sober (admittedly a bit judgementally, which I'm not proud of), and he just shrugged. We continued watching TV and then five minutes later I calmly looked in his eyes and said ""I do not want to be married to an alcoholic who is actively drinking."" His answer was simply ""Fine.""  I reiterated, ""if you want to drink that's up to you, but long term that's where I stand."" And then we kept watching TV for 10 minutes while I quietly rubbed tears from my eyes. I went to look in the fridge, and saw he had bought a 24 pack of beer.

Intent on again avoiding him as he drank all night, I went upstairs to paint the half-done guest bedroom. Crying as I worked. Then I went downstairs to ask him to ""please just don't do this.""

And he got extremely defensive and denied that his drinking was a problem, and we got into a huge fight. About whether or not he had a problem, why it was such a big deal. He said he was functional so it didn't matter. It wasn't an addiction, it was just a bad habit. 

I yelled that the fact that he denied it was a problem was the problem. (Again, not proud of the yelling). I reminded him that he has been diagnosed with a substance use disorder and advised not to drink, that he has an addiction and is feeding that addiction, that it has affected his mental health, his job, and our relationship. He denied all of it. And said that he missed work because of the mental breakdown, not because of the alcohol, and that maybe the alcohol and cannabis helped with his breakdown.

I told him that this was going to ruin our marriage. That we were going to have to sell the house. That he wasn't going to understand until he hit rock bottom, but I wasn't going to be there with him for that. Because I didn't want to get dragged down with him.

And then he poured all his beer down the sink, and started lashing out at me about my bad habits. When I asked if my habits bothered him (fully willing to give them up if they did), he said he was done with the conversation and was going to bed.

I went back to painting the guest room, and he made his bed on the couch. 

Now he's furious at me.

I don't want to get divorced. I love him. I want him to get sober. But I also love myself, and I've seen and dealt with too much alcoholism in my life to want this future for myself.

Am I being unreasonable for not giving him more time to try? Addiction is a disease, and didn't I say in sickness or in health? He's not dangerous or abusive, he hasn't done anything harmful or illegal, but I would rather get out now than spend years getting deeper and deeper into it.

TLDR: My husband is an alcoholic, four months ago I told him it's a serious problem for me, he got sober for a while but now he's off the wagon and in total denial about it, now I'm already giving an ultimatum: sobriety or divorce. 

Am I wrong here? Is there a way for me to support him while also supporting my need for a healthy relationship?",2024-12-29 08:40:34,August,22,1hompf5,15,alcoholism,In a fight I told my husband I would divorce him if he didn't get sober.,0.94
BroomSword,"EDIT:  Theres an AMA im doing on IAMA board but i dont have a link to post so if you have any questions ask them there.

 This is my first time posting here so im a little unsure of how these normally go but am going to be vague on country/ names for obvious reasons. I was 19 and was stood opposite a man in a shithole of a country in Africa shooting a documentary for AIDS/HIV orphans. The ""landscape"" of the country painted to me by the charity itself back in the UK was one of peacefulness and rebuilding, the reality was slightly different. In front of me about 30 meters behind this man (lets call him Bob) were two trucks of heavily armed men who were trying to kidnap me. I stood opposite bob, looked him directly in the eyes and told him i was going to murder every single person who wanted to take me, and i meant it. I had prepared myself over the past three days of sleepless nights, as they shouted my name and reved the engines almost as if to taunt me ,holding a very large machete and coming to terms with what i was about to do. I very quickly realized how far i was prepared to go to protect myself and my life. If it meant doing massive amounts of damage to ensure that: i was firmly in the ""fight"" camp of the""fight or flight"" way of thinking.


When i first arrived i was nearly run over and had a pistol put in my face by this local gang who run drugs and weapons inside the country itself. That very day i bought my machete and used it to protect myself, it is the sole reason im here and able to share this story with you. Statistically speaking most arent alive anymore when going through these kind of ordeals as they are normally kidnapped, tortured or sold into slavery. The phrase ""you have no idea how im feeling"" isnt said to flaunt a higher level of depravity ive experienced its just not many people can relate. Spending a month with no sleep, clutching a razor sharp machete waiting for a gang of armed men to come and grab you at night and preparing yourself to kill is a situation i wouldnt put my worst enemy in, it is a living hell.
Segment 2 - (had a beer and am more able to get this out) I realise there isnt much context to the picture im trying to paint so ill wind it back a bit so you know more about what it is im trying to share.
I like you am smart. Most people i have met with depression are intelligent. This ranges from genius (ive met a few) to the average thinking man or woman. Although being successful in my rugby career (International trials, Academys for pro teams) i am not a violent person, quite the opposite im very quite and well mannered. I dont come from money and most of my wages go to helping put my brother through university or helping to pay for my parents mortgage, charity really is important to me. The reason i got involved with the charity film was i wanted to help a large charity in raising awareness. Working as a KP (dishwasher) for a few years and saving money i funded the entire trip and managed to get my local college (high school in american terms) to lend me a camera and tripod as i was top of my class and the teachers were really behind me in developing.


So im finding it hard to go into details about the month spent there. I honestly want to be able to pour it all out onto this keyboard because at the end of the day i guess im using this as some form of therapy. the best way to put it would be that i learned alot. I filmed corruption, the money raised in UK and Europe was being diverted into drugs and being skimmed. This meant the orphans who i spent alot of time with were sleeping on cold concrete in the middle of winter with no clothes huddled together for warmth. On the odd occasion whilst i was out looking for firewood i would spot toddlers and children walking around with a blunt hacksaw trying to find something to burn to keep themselves warm. Needless to say i gave them everything i had, even the bag i carried with me. It was hugely frustrating and depressing having a tiny child come over and just hold part of you, be it a part of my coat or a shoelace i felt like i somehow embodied protection over the children who otherwise had nobody to be there for them. On returning to the UK i started university. Within two weeks of starting i received a phone call informing me that most of the children that were in the footage i was editing at the time had died. The winter was far too harsh and the money had been misspent and stolen away from them. I cried. Went to my local shop still crying, and bought a bottle of whiskey. The young cashier girl asked me what was up and i paraphrased the situation the best i could. Behind me in the line somebody said ""Im glad, thats a couple less niggers in the world"" I snapped and attacked him. I smashed the bottle over his head and beat him to the ground, it wasnt a fair fight. When i finished beating him covered in blood i spat on him and walked away. Im not proud of this but it became the defining moment in what i now realise was a changing of person, all of a sudden i was isolated (much like in africa), alone and prepared to defend myself and those who were weak from those who were abusive, wrong or too strong for any voice to be heard. I need to take another break, i will continue this i just need to grab some fresh air and probably another beer.


Segment 3 - Im skipping over areas here but i think id rather focus on the important milestones over all the particular details.now im 20 and am having a conversation with a genius about identity. We were sat in a sushi bar in LA (i had befriended his step-son whilst working in the UK and managed to save enough money to get out there across the pond). He worked in a University over in LA and was nominated for the Nobel peace prize, very smart man. We talked about identity. What makes a human being and what defines/ refines us, for two hours over a beer i had the company of someone whos mind was just effortlessly stunning. three months later he was dead, suicide. I realized after the conversation we had he slowly became isolated and wound up one fateful night ending his life, the conversation (i didnt realise at the time) was about him. So during my stay with my american friend (lets call him Buzz) we decide to go to a party thats local. We turn up only to find out that a very close friend of Buzz has been raped violently. Unfortunately this is nothing new to me, i am yet to come into contact with a ""new"" set of depressing realities which is another story all in itself. Skip forward an hour and i find my person stood in a driveway of the girls ex boyfriend (who has a history of abuse towards women) with a baseball bat in my hand. This is where i know ive changed as a person. Im standing in a random persons driveway at 2am in the morning drunk. Im stood there because nothing inside me will back down from the fact that something wrong happened. Im looking down the barrel of a gun once again with a weapon in my hand ready to fight and im not even scared, i even walk towards him. I provoke him as much as i can and even with a loaded weapon i get within striking distance of this guy and he doesnt shoot me, his hand just shook. I remember him saying how he would kill me and i remember not registering it in his eyes, he was terrified. This is the point i realised i was not normal, i was a monster looking for a fight. Subsequently he was arrested for rape and prosecuted successfully, it was Buzz who pulled me away from actually attacking the man in his driveway and rightfully so. I needed help but was too proud and damaged to do so, i was lost. i also need a time out, will post more when im ready to do so.


In an attempt to make my post less monstrous than it already is ill do the last little bit here. Segment 4- So it was my birthday a few days ago, i turned 25. I have the unique answer to all my milestone birthdays (them being 16,18,21,25) in that nothing happened. I sat down on all these days and nobody even noticed, its unfortunate considering im there for them that they cant celebrate a quarter of a century of life with me. In my life ive shouldered problems from rape victims, been there for the birth of an unwanted child to the death of an abusive parent. There is quite honestly nothing ive yet to see thats new and i wasnt prepared for any of it.Ive been beaten, spat on, screamed at, cried on and beld on. I listened and i cried, i wrestled knifes out of peoples hands, even had my best friends blood dripping onto me as the wound in his arm is so deep it pissed all over us as i fight to keep him from killing himself. In the darkest part of lots of peoples lifes i turn out to be the person who talks you down. The thing that upsets me the most is i give a huge amount of energy in being there for total strangers, loved ones, friends and family. When im in need im sat alone again on my birthday with a bottle of champagne i bought myself unwilling to open it as there is nothing to celebrate. The only solace that i take from all of this, and ive barely started talking about my life is this. I was in amsterdam heavily under the influence of many drugs a few months after the africa situation and an old man walked up to me out of the blue. He turned to me and said ""you look angry young man"" to which i replied ""im fine, please go away"". Thinking for a second the last thing i ever heard this man say was ""Holding anger inside you is like holding onto a hot coal. You only burn yourself in keeping it there. you'll only begin to heal when you let it go"". he then turned and walked away.
Its taken almost 6 years to completely understand that phrase.


edit: If you can comment let me know what you think. I know its slightly mish mash in the way im teling my story but thats just the way it seems to be coming out. Considering not a soul has heard it before i appreciate your input if you've read this far thank you.

As I'm (25F) two years sober tomorrow (HELL YEAH!!!) I wanted to be vulnerable and share some of my experiences. Do be aware before you start reading i am talking about my experiences with addiction and so this might be triggering. So if you're not in a good space then lovingly please skip this one ❤️‍🩹


Since trying alcohol as a teenager I had struggled with having way too much and often blacking out and putting myself in dangerous and embarrassing situations and causing myself to have the worst hangovers imaginable. I tried quitting so many times but would always end up drinking again

A couple times I was so drunk, and staying at a friends house, that I pissed myself in my sleep. The most embarrassing thing ever and yet I still couldn't give it up. Another time I was by myself in my uni halls and I woke up realising I had pissed on my floor in my room. This is really embarrassing to share but I think it's important to include 😅 

From around the ages of 20 my hangovers got seriously bad to the point where I would be throwing up constantly for the whole of the day after. I would often spend the day in bed puking into my bin and struggling to get anything down. A few times it landed me in the hospital because I needed IV fluids

One day I went out for lunch with some friends and started drinking at lunch then spent the rest of the day drinking and then being ill. I would find every excuse to drink

When I went on a holiday with my Dad I spent every other night getting completely plastered and then spending the following day in bed with my head in a bin

I went to a concert with my best friend and I ended up getting so many drinks i barely remember the second half of the concert. I spent the next day throwing up in a train toilet on my way back home

Visiting my parents was a big trigger for me drinking and I would often spend an evening drinking and, again, spending the next day being ill

The amount I would drink was often completely excessive and I would cause arguments with friends who were just trying to help cut me off at the end of the night. My life revolved around the next time I'd be drinking. I was in complete denial.

 One hosptial trip I had a chat with a mental health nurse and after opening up about my struggles she told me 'it's normal for students to drink'. The normalisation of drinking to excess, especially for young people, in my country (England) is so bad

The last time I drank I had gone to the pub with some friends and I only drank two pints which for me was a big achievement. However I still ended up constantly throwing up the next day so my friends took me to A&E. That was a massive wake up call for me and it was incredibly difficult but it somehow ended up being the last time I ever drank

The excessive drinking and puking caused me to develop gastritis and so I had to take a PPI for several months.

 My friends helped me so much and were there for me throughout the whole journey and I am forever grateful. I have drifted from some of them but I will never forget how them encouraged me and kept me going

I still struggle with cravings fairly often but drinking alcohol free drinks helps massively. And therapy. Therapy has been a real lifesaver for me. A massive reason i would drink was to avoid certain thoughts and feelings. Starting trauma therapy was one of the hardest things I've ever done but also arguably the best thing I've ever done and will continue to do

For the last few months of quitting drinking and after i was addicted to weed and that funnily enough did help me give up alcohol too because i basically switched from one substance to another. Until a few months later when I went fully sober after developing CHS (cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome) but that's a story for another day 

Since being diagnosed with POTS I realise that along with the sheer amount i would drink, the reason my hangovers were always so unbearable is because they would trigger a POTS flare up

I don't think past me would believe me if I told them that I am now 2 years sober and actually doing okay. I still struggle a lot but I always remind myself how much worse things could be if I was still in active addiction. So here's to me for getting through it 🥹🥳❤️‍🩹

I also want to share some experiences, some beautiful, some dreadful, but all would have been ruined or made far worse if i was still drinking. I need to remind myself why I gave up and how much better things are for doing so

My graduation
If i was still drinking i would have ended up drunk and forgetting half the day. But instead I celebrated with my best friend and my cousin with a wholesome meal and alcohol free prosecco.

Going through CHS while working an intense cleaning job and finding out my Dad was seriously ill. It's almost like my vomiting from alcohol latched onto cannabis and made me give that up too. I was very tempted to relapse with alcohol but I stuck it through

Being in crisis while my Dad was dying (he was 81) but living a few hours away. And when I would visit, getting triggered about being in my childhood home

Getting diagnosed with POTS and having so much of my life finally make sense and learning how to make things easier for myself. Alcohol is a trigger for POTS so there's even more reason to stick to sobriety now!

Going to a peach prc concert (she was one of my inspirations for giving up alcohol)

Thank you for reading if you got this far. I am so f'ing proud of myself and so happy with how far I've come. I'm genuinely so shocked I've made it this far but I did and here's to many more years of sobriety!!",2025-03-17 04:17:42,Unknown,6,1jcxzk3,22,alcoholism,2 years sober! 🥳 Here's my story,1.0
Throwaway_4695,"So, recently I (26F) am doubting if I’m really an alcoholic and if I have a place in recovery groups. 

I didn’t use in childhood like a lot of people did. I mean like experimenting and stuff yes, but not like drinking with friends or anything. I didn’t start drinking “alcoholic-ly” until I broke up with my ex-fiance when I was 22 (we had been together for six years and cohabitated, so it was a big change). And I drank… a lot, and as a coping mechanism, but I think it was a normal amount for a 22 year old likely experiencing adjustment disorder. 

Well, things progressed to the point where I ended up in a psych ward (NOT due to drinking or drugs, it was a suicide attempt) and as part of the intake they suggested me to go to an IOP program. 

The IOP was for like a rehab for drinking and stuff, I thought it was going to be for mental health stuff like group therapy. They convinced me that I was an alcoholic, but I think it was like some brainwash stuff or something because I really don’t have anything in common with anyone that I was in IOP with. 

This was in like mid-late spring 2022. Flash forward to December of that same year. I am experiencing suicidal thoughts again, the local AA club is having a NYE celebration that I heard about from the IOP program. I was like well I can drive my car off a bridge, but first I guess I’ll try this AA thing. 

Got relatively drunk and drove like 10 minutes to my first AA meeting. People are pretty welcoming and stuff, they did a first step meeting for me and all of that. I kept going to AA because I was unemployed and it got me out of the house, and I liked hanging out with people. I never really had a group of friends before. 

I did have a couple “slips” too and drank a few times, at what I would consider to be a relatively normal level. I did start taking Xanax a few months into the program and wound up (intentionally) overdosing. I was in a coma for like 3 days, hospitalized for an additional 3, psych was for a week. 

THEN I begin to emotionally rely on AA. Like I feel better in meetings, it’s like all my friends are there and stuff. I started going to YPAA conferences in 2023, and again I really like the attention and how welcoming stuff is. I’ve never had friends or gone to parties before. 

So now, in January 2025, I have been in the program like 3 years, and have a continuous 18 months of sobriety. I have a sponsor, have worked the steps (still working on finishing all amends), I’m GSR for a young people’s group, and serve on a couple committees for various AA related events. 

But I’m starting to feel like I never fit in here in the first place! Is it possible that I was brainwashed into believing I’m an alcoholic, and that I just like the attention of being in AA? My sponsor said that we can have a larger conversation about it later, once I finish all my amends. People in various AA chats have said this is my disease lying to me, but how can a disease that I don’t have, lie to me? 

People also suggested controlled drinking, which I guess I have done a couple times while working the program. One time I ended up being assaulted while blacked out, but otherwise nothing bad really happened. I was 23 at that time so again it was really kind of age appropriate for me to black out I think and just a random bad occurrence. 

I know ultimately staying with AA and sobriety is a decision only I can make for myself, but any opinions or advice are appreciated! ",2025-01-27 09:05:44,January,15,1iayqaq,5,alcoholism,Doubting My “Alcoholism” at 17 Months,0.86
Dependent-Loan-6032,"I (23 F) found out I was pregnant in May of this year and gave birth to my son 2 months ago. My Brother's fiancee (24 F) found out in November she was pregnant as well. Her and my brother have been together for 6 years now and were actively trying for a child for the last year. Shes lovely. Shes super kind and has this sweet innocence about her. Both of them overcame a meth addiction when they met and have appeared to be doing well ever since. I have been so proud of both of them and I'm incredibly close to to two of them. Finding out we were going to be pregnant together and have our boys 5 months apart felt like a blessing. After a childhood of crazy extended family trauma and losing aunts and uncles to drug and alcohol abuse I was so ready to start new with us kids having babies now and giving these kids the helthy family dynamic we never had growing up. This was all amazing news until 2 weeks into  SILs pregnancy she ended up taking herself to the ER with a blood alcohol over 0.2. I had never known she struggled with alcoholism until this. It was all crazy devastating and incredibly sad to watch my brother go through it and to watch her completely helpless to her addiction. I couldn't fathom being so heavily drunk with a wanted fetus in my belly but I wasn't angry. I sympathized with her and I had hope she and her baby would be ok with therapy and treatment. We checked her into a rehab center that day and set her up with substance abuse counselors for the rest of her pregnancy..... 4 hours in and she checked herself out and assured us she was going to therapy and she could do this and wanted to be better for her baby. 

Fast forward a couple months and she's showing up to things less, she's lying about her wearabouts everyday, and she suffers what she calls ""dizzy spells"" where she's clumsy and trips over her words. She just blamed pregnancy for all of it. We suspected she was still drinking. Without evidence we felt couldn't confront her on it and my if my brother suspected anything she would get incredibly angry and leave. I had my baby and she kind of just disappeared and stopped coming around completely.

Finally at 26 weeks pregnant she is taken to the ER for suicidal thoughts and confesses she's been drinking heavily every. single. day. while pregnant.....everyone was just mortified. Her mom and dad are so floaty and clueless it was mainly my mother and father up there navigating this situation. The whole thing was terrible. My brother was absolutely crushed, he loves that baby already so much. she said she was completely dissociated from her pregnancy to allow herself to keep drinking. She said she's too broken to stop on her own. She again within 4 hours wanted to leave but CPS was called. In our state you can get charged with child abuse for drinking while pregnant.  So she was forced to go to rehab or they would possibly take her baby away. In rehab she still would call my brother blaming him for her being stuck there. After he said no to buying her cigarettes she told him "" he make her want to go out and buy a white claw"" we found out when they are alone she regularly berates him and makes threats. 

She gets 2 weeks through rehab and starts spontaneously bleeding. She is rushed to the hospital by ambulance and they diagnose her with a placental abruption and preform an emergency c section at 28 weeks. The entire family comes to the hospital.The baby was born 2lbs 12 oz.... so small, so weak....they rush the baby to a different hospital she stays back. My brother goes with his baby to the nicu. 

Now that the whole backstory is there now here's the part I need advice for. 

How to I stop hating her so much that it consumes me and show my support in her recovery because that baby deserves his mom to not be a god damn wreak. 

*vent time*

My sympathy for her is GONE. I'm so fuckin mad it's consuming me. The they took her baby to a whole different hospital and she asked more about getting nicotine patches and finding her earings than her own baby!!!??? I get she just went through something traumatic but seriously????? Does she not give a shit about what she did to her own child?? She finally got to the nicu and was complaining that the room was small and my brother has his corner messy. Like LADY YOU ARE THE REASON THIS BABY IS IN NICU. I'm so fuckin mad. I get the best thing for that baby is to not shame his mother and help her through her addiction and mother hood. Everyone is being very gentle with her so she doesn't freak out and feel guilty and start drinking. But all I want to do is scream at her. Shouldn't she feel shame????? As a mother why doesn't she feel awful??? She's making fucking c section mama awareness posts on fb about how strong she is but she fuckin drank that baby out of her womb at 28 weeks. That poor little boy is getting poked and prodded at and is intubated because she wanted to get drunk every day. And I'm supposed to look at that little baby fighting for his life and my brother crushed and not feel all consuming rage towards her??? I'm a brand new mom and I keep my anger so bottled up at visits to the point that a come home and look at my own new baby boy and just cry because I'm thinking of my nephew. I'm so angry I feel depressed. Today the social worker congratulated her that her baby was born with no alcohol in his system??? WHAT??????? SHE GETS A SPECIAL HAPPY MOM STAR BECAUSE HER 28 WEEK  BABY WASN'T BORN DRUNK??? I'm losing it and im so bitter that whenever my mom has anything positive to say about how she's doing, angry lava spills out of my mouth. I get alcoholism is a disease but shes all smiles and happy after possibly giving her baby a lifelong disability. I know the best thing for that baby and my brother is to not say anything and just stay positive and support ( especially because she wants to lean on me as a fellow mom and her only mom friend who knows about her alcoholism) but I'm boiling over. I need to vent, I need to rant, I can't live with all this hate and also support her at the same time. I'm trying really hard but my selfish impulses just want to tell her she's fucking awful for all of this and she failed her baby whenever she makes a comment about how small the nicu room is. I cant stop seeing her as a child abuser while everyone else is hunky dorey.

I don't understand alcoholism 

How do I forgive her?
How do I put away all this rage and hate? 
How do I keep my mouth shut and not blow up?
How do I be the bigger person in this and try to just soley give support and be optimistic.
How do I see her as a person and not a fucking monster?
How do I help her to be a decent mother for this baby? 

Sorry thank you. I need to express this somewhere before I lose it.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning everyone, wishing you a great Tuesday, on this day 3 of my shift, hosting the Daily Check-in.

There are so many different topics to choose from, for this introduction, related to alcohol (addiction, quitting, staying quit, dealing with cravings, fomo, personal growth, emotional recovery and maturity, etc, etc) all of which I find interesting!

And each specific topic will be more or less useful or relevant to you depending on where you are on your sober journey, on how many days/weeks/months/years you have.

So the thing that gets to me the most at this time, is the anhedonia, the days of meh and apathy, when nothing seems to motivate me, and all is grey and boring. When my inner addiction lizard-demon asks me questions like ""What's the point?"", ""Why did you bother quitting?"" and others.

Thankfully it doesn't happen too often now and it eventually goes away (""This too shall pass"")

So today, let's make a list of tips 'n' tools 'n' tricks to combat and get through these grey days.

Here's the ones I know:

1.Salami-slicing
This for me means just taking one small easy task (out of the many that I have to do) and actually doing it! Then I can put a tick (check mark) next to it, or cross it off my list, a feel some satisfaction! If I feel up to it, I can choose another small easy task and repeat.

2.Self-love
This means taking some time out to enjoy a cup of tea, or some chocolate, or ice-cream, whatever your favourite treat is. And just indulge yourself for a while.

I'm only now (at age 61!) learning how to do this, as I was brought up to feel guilty and lazy if I wasn't doing anything ""productive"" or ""useful"".

3.Open air
I find that spending time in the open air makes me feel better. Walking or jogging or running, or even just sitting in a park is good.

4.Empowering myself against my inner lizard-demon! I've read that lizard-demons become especially strong, sneaky and aggressive at the very times that we are feeling weak, down and apathetic. So it's important to kick it's ass hard when this happens. Never engage in dialogue with a lizard-demon, as they are all master alcologicians and they will beat you. Just.Kick.Its.Ass.

What else?

From what I've read, this anhedonia thing comes from an imbalance of dopamine and other neuro-transmitters in our brains, caused by past abuse of alcohol.

But the good news is that our brains can reset and start producing dopamine again naturally. But this obviously takes time, so the longer and more we drank, the longer we have to wait.

Another technique that I used is to just power on through and do the activity, even if I don't enjoy it at the time. For example, going for a run, even though I don't feel like it.

I rationally know that going for a run is good for my body and brain, and the session will be beneficial. Even if I don't actually enjoy it while I'm doing it. So doing that makes it easier next time.

I should use this technique to make myself do horrible paperwork and other online bureaucratic stuff that I hate doing, lol! (Gotta laugh, otherwise it's just too depressing)

Looking forward to reading your tricks n tips.   ",2025-01-21 11:27:52,Unknown,1090,1i6c0rd,434,StopDrinking,"The Daily Check-In for Tuesday, January 21st: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!",1.0
cremainsthesame,"I wish more people knew about this drug. It de-couples the reward mechanisms from opioids and alcohol. You don't get sick when you drink, you just stop enjoying it because you don't get any euphoric effects from it. 

I was a bottle of red per night drinker. Since starting it in October, I haven't so much as even *thought* about alcohol. I have zero cravings now. I even had a small glass of wine at Thanksgiving, didn't feel anything, didn't want more. It's been a miracle for me.

Talk to your doctor to see if it's right for you. Just being able to stop the mental gymnastics of ""will I or won't I"" or embarrassing myself and my family, is a huge weight of my shoulders. Hopefully this post will help some of you.

Edit: Changed ""intoxicating"" effects to ""euphoric"" effects for correctness. 

I did not experience any negative side effects. I take several other medications for anxiety, depression, ADHD, etc  so I take one Naltrexone pill every morning with food and my other meds. 

My doctor suggested the Sinclair method or the daily pill method. I didn't do the Sinclair method because I didn't want the opportunity to talk myself into a pass. 

I never tried to out drink the drug because my desire to quit was outweighing my desire to be drunk, I was starting to have blackouts regularly from not that much alcohol and it quite frankly scared the shit out of me. 

I'm also using therapy, avoiding situations that cause me to drink, and medicating my anxiety, racing negative intrusive thoughts. Plus a little bit of placebo effect. I found a ""why"" - I didn't want to lose my family, job, or go through liver failure. (I do autopsies for a living, so I've seen anatomically the damage it can do).

astro_loser,"I had 18 months sober. It was the hardest thing I’d done, but also the most rewarding. I loved being sober—every part of it (once I finally got there, that is, after two years of relapsing and resetting). Sobriety is truly a magical state of being if the work is done and intentions are good. After 18 months, I started drinking again last spring. It was initially one glass of champagne at a friend’s house, then another glass on my birthday. On both occasions, I didn’t like the taste, I didn’t like the effects, I couldn’t even finish a single glass. A few weeks later, on a vacation with girlfriends in Florida, I thought, I can have a few, fuck, I don’t even like anything about booze anymore! 

That was the start of the end. It was gradual. It was not the case that a drop of booze hit my lips and I was instantly on a bender, instantly back to my old ways. No, it took weeks, months, but honestly—not long. Months before I was drinking like I used to before I’d quit, but then, more terrifying, it got progressively worse and worse, to lower and lower levels that I’d never known even before quitting those 18 glorious months. 

I used to be like you—I never drank in the morning, it didn’t affect my career, I didn’t shirk responsibilities because of alcohol, my relationships weren’t threatened, I didn’t drive drunk—until I did. Until all of those things became true. I did start drinking in the morning—earlier and earlier until I found myself sometimes getting absolutely shitfaced at 8am so I could pass out at noon and sober up by 4pm, only so I could get drunk again in the evening ‘socially’. Or ordering bottles of wine by noon on a Monday because I couldn’t handle the hangxiety from the previous weekend’s bender. My performance at work has absolutely suffered. I have driven drunk now more times that I’d like to admit. The other day I got into my car and found a half-full tumbler of wine in the cupholder, with zero memory of how it got there. I have shirked responsibilities and lost interest in most things I used to care about. I only want to hide at home and drink. But worst of all, my relationships have become threatened. I am about to lose the person who means more to me than anyone.  

I’ve gone through a lot in the last while—separation, moving (twice), the death and illness of dogs, hardships at work, friends moving away, some health issues. I’ve been in a new relationship for almost one year. It was the closest thing to love at first sight that I’ve felt before, I fell so hard, so fast. It has had the highest highs and lowest lows I’ve experienced in a relationship. At first, drinking was fun. I thought I could have a few drinks with my new boyfriend, what was the harm? That was when I’d only just started drinking again. But alcohol has brought out the absolute worst in us, when drunk, we bring out the worst in each other, we fight and argue endlessly. My partner’s gone through even more than I have lately, and instead of supporting him in a loving way, I’ve drank myself numb to avoid the feelings of depression and anxiety that I feel incapable of supporting, considering I’m incapable of dealing with my own feelings of depression and anxiety in a healthy way. I drank more and more and more and more. 

I didn’t just have frequent blackouts and brownouts (which I had ALL the time), I even had full-out psychotic, dissociative episodes. I’ve done things and said things I would never in a million years even fathom doing or saying sober, with no recollection after the fact, or hazy memories that only remind me of my terribleness. I hid bottles of wine all over the place, going to sneakier and sneakier lengths to hide the desperate reality that my consumption was going up exponentially. Wine in coffee mugs. Wine in water bottles. In the produce drawer. In my purse. I felt like I had absolutely zero control over this. Like my conscious, rational brain was literally screaming to me not to drink, I didn’t even want to, alcohol is pure evil. And still, and still, I found my body going through the motions, I found myself pouring more and more of that vile shit down my throat, trying to numb the crushing depression and anxiety.

I’ve read all the quit lit and the science, I understand the battle between the subconscious and conscious parts of the brain when it comes to addiction. Even with that awareness, I’ve felt hopeless and powerless to resist that voice screaming in my brain for more dopamine, more of that numbing liquid that can temporarily obliterate bad feelings. The bad feelings that I know alcohol is causing to begin with.  

I’m a menace to myself and others. I’ve become a monster, a shell of my former self. My former kind, loving, funny, sweet, silly, smart, confident, compassionate, fun-loving self. Now, I feel only self-loathing, shame, embarrassment, anger, confusion, and hatred toward myself. My mental and physical health has reached depths of misery that I’ve never felt before. 

I’ve seen my doctor and therapist recently, who both agree I am at serious risk of harming myself. The psychotic episodes and blackouts their worst concern. They’ve offered medication or referrals to rehab. I told them I wanted to try again, that I knew this was it, the end. Time to stop running, time to stop the insanity, time to stop the exhausting cycle, time to fix myself and heal. 

So here I am, with a lot of work to do, healing to do, pieces to pick up, and relationships to mend—if it isn’t too late. 

Sorry for the long post, but I hope it might help someone.

lemonadesteak,"It's me, Chardonnay Mom. I had a few other posts here, each time talking about how I wanted to stop and how I failed at stopping. My last post was about an ultimatum that my husband gave me after a night where I got so drunk I couldn't and couldn't talk.

Fast forward: I couldn't stop. In fact it got worse. I started sneaking drinks at work, just to kind of get a baseline I guess. A colleague was flirting with me via text every night, encouraging the drinking. He asked me for an affair, I said no. He said he understood, didn't want to fuck up my marriage because he knew we were working on it. He has been in an unhappy marriage for a really long time, has given up on his essentially but I guess we just sort of bonded over having marital struggles. It was kind of nice getting attention from someone--my husband and I hadn't been intimate in weeks, months even. Maybe once or twice, and it sucks you know when you're sleeping in separate parts of the house for all that time. It made it so easy for me to get away with the drinking.

I got called in to work an unexpected overnight shift Friday night, and I'd only gotten a few hours of sleep the night before and the night before that and the night before that. Think like, 3 to 4 maybe MAYBE 5 hours a night once a week. Every single day, 3 or 4 hours. It was wearing on me. Alcohol gave me energy, so I'd do a couple shots in secret just to kinda perk myself up. Anyway, I worked the overnight shift, I just crashed in a room at the hotel I work at. I started drinking just before 6am. My shift wouldn't end until 7am. I knew I had to be back at noon to help with the Saturday shit (I'm the manager, I have to be there all the fucking time and ESPECIALLY on weekends). My colleague was working, he's a chef. He was there by 4am while I was doing the overnight because he had to prepare the banquet for our huge group that was doing their enormous group breakfast at 5:30. He texted me how I was doing around 8ish I guess. I said I was ""already pretty drunk lol"" because it's so funny right. So normal. He was like ""haha awesome."" Asked if I needed anything. I said no, I'm gonna crash because I'm fucking exhausted and I've been awake for like 30 hours, but that I was having trouble sleeping because I finished all my booze and now I was just starving.

He offered to bring me breakfast, I said cool. Asks me my room number, I gave it to him. He brings me some great breakfast, we work in a luxury hotel. He look at me, I'm in my pajamas. Says ""nice tits,"" and I was like ""oh, uh, haha yeah thanks"" because awkward. Next thing I know, he turns the light off, I'm on my back and my shirt is off. I didn't really know what to do, I felt like I invited this but I didn't want to cheat on my husband. I said in the weirdest wording of all time ""what if I asked you to stop right now?"" and he goes ""I won't stop. You like it rough you dirty fucking slut."" I let him do a lot of things to me. He called me a lot of things.

He went back to work like it was nothing, texted me a bit later to tell me how hot it was. I went across the street to the bar and got a double shot of whiskey and downed it like it was nothing. Normally I need a chaser. I kept drinking. Next thing I know I'm on the top of the parking structure in my work clothes, with my legs over the edge. I felt like I had an affair, like I was all the things he called me. What if I did like it, what if I wanted it, what if all this and all that. I was outside so long I burned the shit out of my face and arms from the sun. My friend picked up something was wrong, she drove 35 minutes to talk me off the ledge and sat with me outside for a few hours. My sister drove two hours from up north, she stayed with me. Everyone thought I was having a panic attack because by now I hadn't slept in almost two days.

I went back to that room, I could see the plate of food he brought me on the table. I slept in that bed. Except I couldn't sleep. I had to work at 5:00am. I did. It was really busy. I acted normal. He was there, he made a sly joke about carpet burns on his knees.

I left at 9:00am, was supposed to stay till noon. I went to the store to get milk and baby food and apple juice and bread and I bought a small hideable thing of whiskey. I started drinking it right away. By 2:00pm my BAC according to my breathalyzer that I bought months ago said 0.07 so to me that meant not drunk, because I didn't feel drunk. I kept drinking all afternoon through all the father's day stuff. No one knew I was drinking though. I was sneaking shots of vodka while everyone was outside. I probably did three or four total.

Got in an argument with my husband because of course I picked a fight because I was drunk. I put the baby down, and while my husband was giving our toddler a bath, I grabbed my keys and left. Didn't even put socks on, just left. Parked my car somewhere downtown. I went bar to bar ordering double shots of whiskey shaken over ice and downing them, closing out right away and going to the next bar. I called my sister, I told her I cheated on my husband. I told her what happened. She tried to tell me it wasn't my fault, I didn't believe her. I was so drunk, I don't know what I said, but the next thing I know I'm on the phone with a police officer named Ryan. He was trying to find me. I didn't want to talk. My husband called me, begged me to come home, and I said no.

I don't know what I told him, but I know that I said I was going to kill myself.

I couldn't live with the fact that I let some other man fuck me. He was sober and I was wasted and he knew it. The cops picked me up somewhere random, some random city street where I'd never be. I drove drunk, I never drive drunk. I always just walk. The car was missing for days, no one knew where it was. We found it yesterday, the tire was blown out and it was parked on the wrong side of the road. I'm so ashamed.

Anyway, the ER said my BAC was 0.30%. Nobody asked me about the bruises. They cuffed me, took me to the county behavioral place where lowlifes like me wait for their place at a halfway house. Except I'm not a lowlife, I'm a successful manager at a luxury hotel, I run a team of 30 people over four departments. I'm a married mother of two young boys. I'm a published writer. I owned a home before 30. I'm training for a half marathon.

Escorted by police in cuffs to this awful facility, I had to strip in front of two strangers and shower in front of them. I had to wear their horrible oversized clothes and I still hadn't slept. By now I'd been up for three days. Probably still drunk, just wanted to go home and sleep. They put me in a room with the lights on, a rubber mattress and a thin rubber pillow so I still can't sleep. The asshole psychiatrist put me on a fuck ton of meds after talking to me for five minutes, told me 72 hour hold for detox. Nobody asked me why I wanted to die, or why I drank that much. Nobody cared. I finally got home yesterday.

I'm a bug in a jar. My husband won't even look at me, he just looks so hurt. My best friend drove up from an hour or so away to spend the day making calls to find treatment for me. I'm using a breathalyzer every couple hours. I can't drive anywhere on my own, my family doesn't trust me. I don't blame them. The bruises on my arms and back and legs are widespread and disgusting. I told my therapist yesterday about it. It's summer, it's 90 degrees and I'm wearing a heavy sweatshirt everywhere. I took it off and she knew something happened, my hands kept shaking. I told her what happened.

So now I am having to learn how to cope with this trauma I guess, I still blame myself and I am overcome with this crushing shame and guilt. My husband is traumatized and distant. We can't be there for each other. My family is not sure what to do or how to act. Only a couple people now know about Saturday. But the bruises are so huge and everywhere, I don't want anyone to see.

At some point I'm supposed to go to this domestic violence resource center today for STD testing. I'm horrified. I started my period like a week early, it's much much much heavier than usual and that's confusing to me and overwhelming.

Tomorrow I have intake at an alcohol outpatient facility with counseling, it will be twice a week. I'll have marriage counseling once or twice a week, I'll have regular therapy for depression and trauma at least once a week, and counseling for addiction twice a week. How do I deal with all three of these things all at once?

I don't know if I can do it.

EDIT: Sorry that I inspired so much debate about what's considered sexual assault and what isn't.  I still blame myself, but I'm done telling myself that I cheated.  Idk, if you think I had it coming then you're probably right. I still don't know how to feel, but I know I didn't want it.

Bonjour and Good Morning SD Gang - ha ha, not only is it Friday but it’s Friday the 13th! 

Coming home last night and reading all of the qualities you appreciate about yourselves, was a wonderful way to end my day. Heartfelt thanks to everyone who participated in an important but sometimes difficult exercise. I feel that I have gotten to know you all a little better through it and that makes me happy.

Today’s topic is reflecting on the benefits that sobriety can bring. We often have a goal in mind when we first get sober, and then along the way are pleasantly surprised by benefits we hadn’t given much thought to previously.

My initial objective when getting sober was to see if I could improve my mental health. I had been so cripplingly depressed for decades, it was the overriding priority for me. As is often the case, this was accompanied by terrible insomnia and the typical unstable, non-pattern sleep of an alcohol abuser.

It wasn’t until I got sober and enough time had passed to enable me to establish a stable sleep routine, that I realised just how poor my sleep had always been. Nowadays, my sleep is amazing, truly restorative, and being able to take a refreshing nap is a luxury I never thought I’d have. Now that I’m not drowning my brain in poison, I can really hear it telling me when I need more rest.

What is a benefit that has sneaked up on you since getting sober? What is a benefit that you can’t wait to experience?

As always, I will not drink poison with any of you today ❣️

Love Cinq

What’s happening people? Hope everyone’s weeks are going splendidly. On one of my podcasts today they were talking about time. It was said that if you spend too much time thinking about the future it causes anxiety and too much time thinking about the past causes depression. This hit home real hard cause the two biggest factors for my alcohol abuse were low and behold anxiety and depression, both causes and effects. Drinking made me only think about the past (oh shit who did I text last night) and the future (where am I getting my next drink). Was never living in the now. 

I think a big part of having so many day ones for me was because I couldn’t let the shame of the past go and couldn’t picture a happy future without alcohol, still stuck in the depression of the past and anxiety of the future. This is why forgiving myself for being addicted to a highly addictive substance celebrated in our society and also just taking it one day at a time worked for me. It got me out of that endless loop of anxiety and depression that I had whether I was drinking or not. Just had this epiphany, thought I’d share. Have a great one everybody! IWNDWYT

Limp_Flow_8252,"I fucked up and ruined my life. Apologies for the long post ahead. My mind is still racing from everything and English is my second language.

I've made so many mistakes due to my alcoholism but last night takes the cake. I've lived in denial for so long. I have scars on my body from blackouts where I've hurt myself. I've been left in many relationships due to my drinking. I'm so ashamed of what I've exchanged for alcohol.

I'm on a family vacation in Mexico City. With my mom, siblings, partner and 1 year old baby. Feelings have gotten intense with family throughout the whole week, and I've been repressing everything and finally snapped after drinking too much. Stupid things from my mom berating me, showing preferential treatment to my brother. Dumb family things. There is also a history of abuse there. My mom abused me physically and mentally as a child  (and oldest). Although my siblings saw, they were spared the abuse thankfully.

My partner, brother, and I had been drinking the whole night. Taking shots. Having a good time. I don't know what set me off and it's honestly not an excuse. The whole week my brother had also been making sexist jokes towards me, randomly saying that if I was a man, he'd kick my ass. I honestly don't know why we were drinking together. We were trying to move past things.

Anyways. It was my partner, brother, baby and I at our AirBnB. We were hanging out - the rest of the family was supposed to join us the next day as they were staying at my mom's house which happens to be further away from downtown.

My partner and I got an AirBnb in the middle of downtown cause we were WFH on Wednesday and wanted to be central to things so we could go to the Zoo during our lunch break, and be able to walk around after work.

I don't know at what point my brother and I started arguing. I'm a 5'4 woman, he's a 6' man. I don't know what sparked it but I think we got physical with each other and at one point he sat on top of me and was mocking me, laughing in my face. Something in me SNAPPED. I felt like my partner was taking his side (not acknowledging that we're both drunk and both out of line). When my brother let me get up, I went off on him, hitting him, scratching him, etc.

I guess at one point I threw a plate at him. Picked up the plate and cut his arm, cut my hand. I guess my partner tried to intervene and hold me down and I swung at him, busting his lip. He was holding our baby and he said I hit her by proxy of hitting him. My partner claims we ran out in the street and I was chasing him and the baby because he wouldn't let me hold her.

I was diagnosed with PPD, and post partum rage but this was something different. All the feelings of resentment I'd been holding onto with my partner all came out as well. We've had a rocky relationship and haven't treated each other the best. He was borderline abusive, isolated me during my pregnancy, and had a video game addiction.

We've gone to couples counseling. I started seeing my own counselor and I got put on Wellbutrin. He's not perfect, but he's a good man, loves me and is putting in the work for our relationship.

None of this is an excuse. I've had violent tendencies in the past, but this was more than 10 years ago. I've tried to put in a lot of effort to work on myself and better myself. I'm feeling incredibly disappointed. Disgusted. Ashamed.

Anyways. My partner is American (we are Mexican) so he doesn't know how the cops are corrupt out here. He got scared and called the police. This was all happening at 12am. While he was holding our baby. Who I'm pretty sure saw me lose my shit.

The cops came. Threw my brother and I in cop cars. One cop groped me multiple times. They stole the jewelry I was wearing. Stripped me of the gold and silver I wear. Threatened to arrest my partner too and take away our baby if we didn't comply, despite me insisting he had no part in the fight and it was mainly me who was the aggressor (I think).

I was able to call my mom and uncle who lives in CDMX and is more familiar with the laws out here.

The cops extorted my mom out of $500. They finally let us go and when we went back inside the Airbnb we saw they ransacked our things as well. They stole my partners work laptop. His AirPods. His iPad. His jewelry. His wallet. Our cash. My cell phone. My brothers cell phone. They withdrew 3K from my partners bank account somehow.

We didn't  notice until after they left. When we went to the police station to file a complaint, we were told they can't trace what cops responded to the call.

I stayed with my mom. My partner stayed at the Airbnb. We went over in the morning so I could drop off his and the babies passport. He understandably decided to get an earlier flight back and decided to take the baby with him. He refused to speak to me. My mom and uncle were able to support him by helping him pack everything, take him and baby to the airport and lent him cash for food. For that I am eternally grateful.

My brother is understandably upset with me. No one is really telling me what happened so I have no choice but to believe I snapped for some reason.

My partner and I were supposed to move to a different city together in a month for a job opportunity he was offered. We were supposed to get married. We've been working so hard to make our relationship work and have a healthy relationship - something we've both never seen modeled. I've gotten drunk before and picked petty fights with him. I've wet the bed from being so drunk and he let me know it disgusted him. He's understandably done with me now. He wants nothing to do with me. This was just too much. Seeing him sob this morning broke me.

Who knows what will happen now. He'll probably still move, will try to get full custody (he has pics of his injuries), and we will separate.

Aside from the material things we lost, I've disrespected and humiliated my partner. He couldn't look at me without starting to sob.  I've abused my brother. My family is so so upset with me. Understandably so.

We were supposed to be getting ice cream today after work and instead I'm writing this from uncles house hoping this is a nightmare I will wake up from. I basically trashed the Airbnb. Which will cost my partner hundreds of dollars, on top off the $800 he paid so my family can all stay together and be comfortable. I feel utterly hopeless. We had fun vacation plans. Instead I get to sit here and think about how nothing will ever be the same between us and it's because of me. I lost everything I truly value - my little family.

The only thing keeping me going is the thought of being able to see my baby in the future. She's the light of our life. I'm ashamed she had to witness all of that. We're SO careful to never argue in front of her, or with her even in the house. We're so careful to try to shield her and protect her innocence. then I go and act like this in front of her

Both my partner and I came from abusive childhoods and have faced a lot of trauma. We're trying to intentionally break the cycle of intergenerational trauma. My grandfather died from alcoholism and I'm going down the same route if I don't stop drinking today.

I hope my post serves as a warning to someone out there. Many times I tried to stop drinking then rationalized to myself that I'd just drink wine/beer, then a couple shots here and there. Eventually I'd drink enough to black out and end up regretting some stupid shit I'd say or do (like getting so drunk on my birthday that I was flashing people while walking down the street). I can't believe I chose alcohol over my beautiful little family. Over our baby.

I've made an appointment with my therapist and will finally admit to her I'm an alcoholic. I'v never admitted that out loud. I'd ready to get help. I'm ready to quit. Maybe I've already ruined my relationship, but I will work on changing so I don't disrespect myself and others like that again. I am utterly devastated.

I've used alcohol to cope with so much childhood trauma. Being sexually abused by a neighbor at 12 during a summer break. Parental abuse. Poverty. I'm done using alcohol as a ""crutch"". I'm not normally religious, but today I prayed to God. I prayed for the strength to change.

Thanks for making it this far; I won't drink with you today.

PassivePitchfork," These are the things I remind myself of when I feel moments of weakness... this is why I'm sober.

\- It does not matter whether or not I have a problem with alcohol... alcohol IS ITSELF A PROBLEM. It is incredibly important for me to understand and internalize this simple fact.

\- By abusing alcohol I have formed neural pathways that will never go away. If I drink again, I will pick up exactly where I left off, with shame and regret added on top. The neural pathways formed from alcohol abuse are like a stream or a river bed. As soon as I stop drinking, the river runs dry, and it will stay that way for as long as I don't drink. Those pathways are permanent though... and as soon as a rainstorm comes, I can be sure the water is going to run that same ravine.

\- If ever I drink again, I will be underwhelmed by how it makes me feel. The alcohol won't be relieving any withdrawal symptoms and will only make me feel foggy and out-of-sorts. This will cause me to drink more to numb the feeling of being let down. Right back into the pit of despair, I go. I hate to say that I had to test this fact repeatedly to finally understand it.

\- Due to fading affect bias, I will slowly forget how truly miserable I was while drinking. This is a natural defense mechanism and is just simply how humans are wired. It is what allows us to move on from the terrible things that life throws our way. It's important to recognize this fact and take off the rose-colored glasses, especially when the sun is shining.

\- Despite what many people believe, drinking is an incredibly anti-social thing to do. There are few things less attractive than a person talking way too loud, repeating nonsense, and struggling to remember things with breath reeking of booze.

\- As much as I don't want to believe it, everyone else could see my problem. I thought I was sneaky. I thought I was clever. I can now see that this just isn't true. People were just nice enough to not say anything about it.

\- Drinking does not give me confidence. Alcohol prevents any chance of my brain producing the natural feel-good chemicals that make me feel confident. When I do not feel confident in a social situation, it is just my brain's natural defense mechanism. My brain is assessing threats and making sure everything is safe. Just like a kid at a birthday party who clings to their mother's leg at first, then 15 minutes later is running around screaming with joy. I should give myself 15 to 30 minutes and see how I feel. If it still doesn't feel right, I should get the hell out of there! My brain is trying to tell me something. Shortcutting this natural process IS NOT CONFIDENCE, IT'S COWARDICE.

\- Even a SINGLE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE will chronically disrupt my natural REM sleep cycles, degrading my mental health and sense of well-being. Coupled with nutrient deficiencies and dehydration, I felt truly and inescapably awful while drinking.

\- The depressant effect of alcohol causes my brain to produce stimulants to counteract it. These stimulants get processed more slowly and cause me to feel anxious and unsettled when the alcohol wears off. The result is continuing to drink to maintain a balance. These stimulants are the source of the dreaded anxiety the next day, and also the reason that the following day's drink feels like genuine relief. Don't fall for that shit, PassivePitchfork! It's a lie! It is this simple cycle that makes alcohol feel like such a trap.

\- Alcohol is a poison that I've slowly trained my body to be able to process in large quantities. I could do the same thing with other poisons like arsenic... but why the fuck would I ever want to do that?

\- ANYONE who drinks alcohol risks addiction. ANYONE. Alcohol is an addictive poison. Alcoholism is not a character flaw or a genetic predisposition... it is simply the result of training my subconscious to believe alcohol provides some sort of genuine relief or crutch. It is all an illusion.

\- Contrary to what many may say, willpower is not the key to maintaining sobriety. White-knuckling is incredibly challenging because I constantly deprive myself of what I think I want. At some point, I will forget how truly miserable I was and I will slip up. Instead, I need to understand and remind myself of exactly what alcohol does to my brain and body to genuinely not want any part of it. Then it's easy! Relatively speaking anyway...

\- Alcohol provides absolutely zero benefits. ZERO. If I choose to believe otherwise I am lying to myself. Alcohol is simply the result of what happens when things ROT. It is poison. The only thing that alcohol can do for me is slowly erode my health, finances, relationships, confidence, and sense of purpose.

\- There is no such thing as normal drinking or normal drinkers. There is absolutely nothing normal about wilfully consuming an addictive poison.

\- The bum on the street slamming cans of hurricane and plastic bottles of vodka wasn't always that way. In fact, they were probably once just like me. They are just further down the spiral... the same spiral that everyone who drinks alcohol is on. The circumstances may differ dramatically but the trajectory is always the same. It just depends on how quickly one progresses through the stages, how quickly the neural pathways are formed, and how quickly the subconscious is trained that a drink provides some genuine relief or crutch.

\- There is always talk of rock bottom. Yeah yeah I know rock bottom is where I stop digging. The truth though, is that the only real and inevitable rock bottom is a premature grave.

I compare my experience with alcohol addiction to swimming out in open water in the fog. It was like I was testing how far I could swim out and still have the energy to swim back, hoping I'd still know which direction to go. I knew in my soul that if I pushed it too far I'd be lost forever. It's the stuff of nightmares. Now I'm 384 days in and my mental health has improved immeasurably. I was in a darker place than I was willing to admit to any of you. I knew what I needed to do but I didn't know how. I had to study the shit out of it and test these truths for myself. Thankfully I didn't ruin relationships, lose a job, get a DUI, or hurt anyone... but I just got lucky. I was playing with fire.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Monday, sobernauts! I loved hosting you all on Sunday! So much talk about joyful moments with pets, kiddos, books, lovely hangover-free mornings listening to the birds... I wish I had the time to comment on every one, because you all deserve it!

Today I'm thinking about something my therapist and I cover often... In this group we focus (rightly so) a lot on the things that addiction has taken away from us. We remind ourselves and each other of the mornings lost to hangovers, our confidence, health, relationships, jobs... A lot of us have lost a lot, and that is why we are here.

But for all of us, there is also a reason we began using alcohol. Drinking can steal so much, but we returned to it again and again because at one time, it did serve a purpose. Framing alcohol abuse in this way, as a mechanism for survival that has long outworn its usefulness, has allowed me to release some of the shame I carry. I was doing my best with the tools I was given, and alcohol, for a time, was a fast-pass. Until it really really wasn't. 

I'd like to encourage you today to reflect on the person who first found solace in drinking, to think about what purpose it was trying to serve, and give that searching person some compassion. For me, alcohol allowed me to express emotions like anger and sadness that I was not allowed to express in my household growing up. I have a lot of compassion for the child that felt the need to poison herself in order to feel heard. Of course, that eventually turned me into an angry drunk who word-vomited (and then literally vomited) every half-baked angry thought in my head. Today, with tools like therapy and journaling, I am slowly learning new ways to express those emotions with more balance, and without injuring myself or others.

If you are here, it is because you are looking for or are finding better tools to utilize, and that is amazing. So worth celebrating. What purpose did alcohol originally serve you, and what are you doing today to address those needs instead? 

So much love, I hope today is wonderful. IWNDWYT!",2024-04-08 09:30:12,Unknown,721,1byofaz,287,StopDrinking,"The Daily Check-In for Monday, April 8th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!",0.99
lepetitpigeon,"I realize now that I drank too much. 


Most people who know me would claim otherwise. I don't make dramatic scenes, blackout, or get sick. I am a productive member of society, I keep up with my active son, and generally have my shit together. 


But I had a habit of red wine every night, two heavy poured glasses, often followed by a final ""splash"" before bed. I was consistent with it for years. I finished kid bedtime and as I poured my wine from that silly boxed-wine spigot, relief poured over me. 


I deserve this, I would think. I deserved it for being a kick-ass mom. I earned it for role modeling positivity to my son through a Pandemic. It was a reward for enduring brutal allergy shots with my 7 year old. It was a consolation prize for all the fun times we were missing during quarantine. It was how I relaxed at the end of a long day.   


It is symbolic, I loved to rationalize. This wine marks the end of being ""mom"" and starting the evening as this autonomous grown-ass woman.


I think once you start imbuing alcohol with these transcendent qualities, you're shifting from a healthy relationship to an unhealthy one.  


When you start perceiving alcohol as a positive tool in your self care, not having it feels like deprivation. I was physically fine if I didn't drink, but I did feel left out and grumpy. I felt less happy and mentally noted when I could remedy the problem of not drinking.


That was the red flag for me. Thankfully I didn't need to hit a rock bottom, I just needed a to start Dry January only to realize ""Hey, Dry January sucks, this is HARD."" And to start reflecting what that meant for me and how I felt about it. 


If the idea of not drinking negatively impacted my life, what does that mean about the role alcohol is playing in it?


I went fast and hard down the Quit Lit path and much to my delight there were resources out there that resonated with me perfectly. It wasn't about being powerless and depending on a power greater than myself (not a dis to AA - it just didn't fit my personal relationship with alcohol). I discovered books and podcasts that approached alcohol with brain science! Do you really know what is happening biologically when you consume alcohol? They were about cognitive dissonance! If I WANT to drink less, why then is it so hard? They were about culture, society, and marketing! What message is the world bombarding you about the role of alcohol and what subconscious effect does that have on us? 


It was a fascinating journey into the science of habits, addiction, and mindfulness. 


And this is where it loops into parenting. Because while not drinking has certainly saved me money, calories, and made me a grossly cheery morning person, it has also made me a fundamentally more mindful person. And mindfulness when parenting is a serious net gain.


The other day my kid was losing his mind at the hospital during his allergy shot appointment. It was a scene, to say the least. It dawned on me that I would have once thought to myself ""Man, that glass of wine tonight will be MUCH deserved!"" and then try to tolerate the experience and eagerly await 8PM. 


Seems relatively harmless, I know, but then I look at how I approach the situation now. 

Instead of basking in my misery and awaiting my ""reward,"" I spent that 30 minute wait after his shots reflecting.


I felt frustrated this is still so difficult for my kid.


I felt embarrassed because no one enjoys making a public spectacle.


I felt sad because my kid was so upset.


I felt guilty for, well, a whole host of reasons parents feel guilty.


I felt worn down.


And I felt those feelings, which sounds absurdly simple, but how often do we just feel stressed or overwhelmed without actually breaking that shit down? The magic happens when you give those feelings the attention they deserve and you start getting good at realizing which thoughts are productive and which thoughts are best to let go. You can validate and normalize certain feelings, which does wonders for not getting absorbed in them and giving yourself permission to move on. Being mindful in that moment meant that by the time we left the hospital, I put in some work on those feelings and felt ready to move along with my day. I wasn't counting down until evening wine, I didn't feel emotionally dependent on a magic elixir to bring me comfort. We had a shitty time at the hospital and it was done now. 


I realize now it wasn't the wine that brought me comfort, it was the idea and the ritual of the wine.


The best part of drinking was getting my glass, filling it up, and taking that dramatic big sigh on the couch as I enjoyed my first sip. 


That's not really about the wine then, is it? I didn't feel relieved or content in that moment because of the alcohol, it literally hadn't even reached my stomach yet. It's that I had conditioned myself for years to think I needed it to relax and destress. Our thoughts are very powerful in creating our reality. If you associate drinking with the way you best unwind, shocker shocker, you reach the point you feel like you can't unwind without it.


I feel the happiest I've ever felt in my adulthood, and I attribute much of that to spending more time reflecting on feelings and finding habits that truly benefit my physical and emotional health. 


So I now do things I would have once scoffed at, like go to bed early. For a long time I felt like staying up late was vital because it was my precious ""me time."" I now realize that browsing Reddit on the couch is far less bucket filling than finally tackling this 8 years of sleep debt (thanks, kid).


I sip tea and work on puzzles. Yes, it may not be the hip cool way to spend my night (according to every commercial marketing firm out there) but that's something that actually relaxes me after a stressful day of Pandemic parenting. I am not buzzed or numbed in my senses, I'm meditative and calm. At peace.


I've stopped equating consumption with happiness. Food and drinks can taste good, and it is perfectly wonderful and acceptable to enjoy them! But they are not gateways to happiness. Feelings do not have to hinge on them. They don't fix things. And the more you associate these concepts with them, the unhealthier the relationship you foster with them.  


And best of all, I am a much more present parent. Being mindful about this one thing has made flexing that muscle come more naturally. When I'm stressed or anxious, I spend less time wallowing in those feelings and wishing the time to pass so it can be over. 


The other day featured a rough parenting afternoon and I found myself counting down until my kid's bedtime. I realized I didn't want to spend my time simply waiting for the next thing to happen and I reflected on what was really going on. I had reached my emotional capacity of dramatic play with a seven year old, I was hungry, I was yearning for some adult interaction. 

So I kindly expressed I had reached my limit of pretending to be a baby bird to my son. I dug out some science magazines he hadn't seen yet to occupy him. I cut apples and cheese slices. I reached out to my friend group via text and vented and was then beautifully enriched by their amazing insight and hilarity. I wasn't waiting for his bedtime anymore and when I was finally ""off the hook"" of parenting, I no longer needed something to make it better. It was a far cry from ""Grrrr... is it wine o'clock yet?""


Wine wasn't the answer to the things I was looking for. I've learned that feeling good about being a kickass mom is the reward. What I earn for role modeling positivity during the Pandemic is a better mindset for me and my family. The reward for surviving allergy shots is that my kid won't go into flippin' anaphylactic shock the next time he's stung by a wasp! I can grieve the lost fun times during a Pandemic because it is disappointing and sad, and a consolation prize doesn't somehow negate those very real feelings. I unwind by being cozy on the couch with my husband, writing rambling emails to friends I miss, and getting a really good night's sleep.


So I am no longer a card-carrying member of the Mom Wine Club. It didn't make me a better mom in the ways I once thought it did. I'm learning to put in the work in the moment instead. And I am much happier and healthier for it. ",2021-02-13 17:19:26,Unknown,297,liz5az,2075,StopDrinking,Another mother quits the Mom Wine Club!

Erinjoywink21,"Hey everyone I’ve been reading this sub for years but never posted and I’m struggling with insomnia so I thought I’d finally share my story.

I have been sober since early October of this year. I’m not sure of the date as I found in the past counting the days and months only seemed to make me feel suffocated by a timeline and getting through just one day at a time, hell even one moment at a time was easier for me.

My husband has been sober for 18 months an accomplishment that felt impossible for the both of us. We originally got sober at the same time but I ended up relapsing after 5 months. I am so extremely proud of him and have loved watching him thrive in sobriety. We drank together for 8 years both of us in the strong grips of addiction from the time we met. 

Our journey has been chaotic and painful. When we were drinking we would fight and argue and towards the end it started to get physically abusive and a change needed to happen. On October 27th 2021 I brought my husband to the ER for alcohol withdrawal’s and he was sent to inpatient treatment. He quit his job two months prior with the intent of going to treatment but continued to drink more and more from the time he woke up until he passed out making the steps to getting into treatment impossible for him. All while I worked and covered all expenses by myself. When he went to detox his DT’s were so bad they couldn’t treat him so he had to be sent to the ICU and after two days of hallucinations and being strapped down given medication he was finally able to get into an inpatient program where he stayed for 13 days then did outpatient for a few months after. I also quit drinking at the same time but continued working and supporting our household to give him the opportunity to get the help he needed. I have a therapist but I didn’t get treatment and I ended up relapsing during a bout of mania from my undiagnosed bipolar disorder that lasted from April to September last year.

Since my husbands experience was so horrible and traumatic our families and friends only asked about and supported him. I had to be the strong one to keep it together to pay the bills to support his treatment. Everyone knew I also got sober but nobody ever asked how I was doing it was all about my husband. I know that sounds shitty to say but I just felt alone and forgotten. 

I got sober again for me and because I realized how selfish I was being hiding my drinking from him (he knew we really aren’t that clever). I didn’t share my sobriety this time with anyone but my therapist and my husband. Nobody cared before so why would they care how? While my husband attends AA and works through the steps it has never been something I’ve found helpful or been interested in.

Two months into being sober this time I got pregnant. We are extremely excited and it felt like the universe was finally giving us permission to move on and be happy but I am struggling. I was looking forward to quitting drinking so I could feel good but I’ve been sick a lot with the pregnancy and some days it feels like I’m back to where I was months ago. I want to drink because I’m so stressed from everything changing now and what’s going to change in the future but obviously I can’t and won’t.

My progress with sobriety is only known to my therapist and husband. I’m struggling through silently while now everyone still talks about how proud they are of my husband and they ask about the baby. But got damnit I am proud of myself. I have never been sober this long and it hasn’t been an easy journey I struggle with PTSD as well as bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety the perfect “cocktail” of mental Illness I self medicated for.

Anyways if you read this long thank you for reading and hearing my story. I want you all to know I am proud of you no matter how long you have been sober if its 2 hours or 30 years you are amazing. Whether you share your progress or silently make it through the days I see you and I will not drink with you tonight.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your comments I really didn’t expect this post to get so much attention but I have read every single one of your comments and will continue to do so and will save this post to look back on to read all your encouraging words and stories so similar to mine. I appreciate all of you who took time to read and comment I really needed your encouragement right now. 🙏🏻",2023-05-03 16:32:04,April,168,136h9pt,1479,StopDrinking,My sobriety lives in the shadows of my husbands sobriety.,0.98
East-Platform3893,"A year ago I woke up with one of the worst hangovers of my life. I couldn’t find my phone and my wife of six months wouldn’t talk to me. As had become a toxic pattern more and more frequently, I had drunk far too much the night before, lost all sense of who I was and what was right or wrong, and hurt those that I love. I won’t go into detail about the things I did, but it’s fair to say that an ultimatum was presented to me: give up drinking or have a divorce less than a year into marriage. The initial response was the denial in me and refusal to accept how bad the problem was, this turned into anger, and then pure sadness. Then the complete hopelessness and lack of desire to live any more. I even called a suicide hotline. This was my rock bottom, but I made it through to day 2.

On day 2 I found this group and posted a rather desperate message asking for guidance for how to deal with the anxiety and depression that came alongside the hangover that wouldn’t disappear. I was met with nothing but support, kindness, understanding, and not an ounce of judgement. This helped me get through to day 3. I then returned to the group and continued reading the stories of those who were in a similar place to me. This helped more than I can describe. I continued to do this into day 4, 5, 6, 7, and for the weeks that followed. I then found the anxiety slowly started to ease its grip on me. Not let go altogether, but I could breathe that little bit better.

Before I knew it I had reached the one month mark and felt like I had accomplished more than anything I have ever accomplished in my life before that point. I continued to visit this group daily and read the stories that were posted, offered my own kindness in return and just focused on getting through one more day without that drink. My first big test came just six weeks in where I did a stag do in Amsterdam completely sober (talk about a fucking trial by fire). When I arrived home I posted on this group about how proud of myself I was. Again, I was met with nothing but kindness and support.

By two months in I started to find my confidence again. There was a light starting to appear at the end of that long, seemingly endless, tunnel. There was a feeling of maybe life is just… better this way. Fast forward the rest of the year (I don’t want to bore you with every little detail), but I am now writing this to you after a New Year’s Day that I spent sober, hangover-free, proud of the fact that I just spent the past year of my life sober. Not only do I feel healthier, but my head is healthier (not perfect - there’s still plenty of work to be done), I am still married and our relationship has never been stronger. Oh, and I’m also going to be a dad. That’s quite a transformation from receiving that ultimatum just one year ago.

So why am I rambling on about all this? Because I was once you. I was ready to give up on everything. Convinced that life wasn’t worth living and that it would probably be a better place without me in it. I was convinced that the grip alcohol had on me would never cease and I would continue to live in a toxic spiral of denial until I did something so extreme that myself or those around me would forever suffer the consequences. But I’m here to tell you that this is not the only option. You are worth so much more. And you can get there… One. Day. At. A. Time.

So here’s to the end of Day 1 without alcohol. To those of you that need the kindness or support that I needed 365 days ago, I’ve got you. And I will promise you one thing: I Will Not Drink With You Today.

EDIT: I am so overwhelmed by the reaction this post has gotten. I was hoping at least one person would find it useful but I’ve been blown away by the positive comments you’ve all responded with. I’ve read every single one. Remember that you are strong and you can do this. Be kind to one another, but most importantly be kind to yourself ❤️",2024-01-02 03:49:40,Amsterdam,176,18w8hmu,922,StopDrinking,To those of you on Day 1…,1.0
Pleaseworkarc,"*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Welcome to the Daily Check-in on this Sunday morning in January. I’ll begin with a thank you to Replacement Stink   for kicking off 2023 for us with such enthusiasm and energy.  Thank you also to St Homer for letting me host the Check-in this week. 

This week I will try to say it as I see it and then share a tool, mindset or a tactic that I have used and found helpful. A lot of them were learnt here or as a result of things I have read or picked up in counseling. I am not the finished article - I am in early recovery. 

A quick introduction seems appropriate. I was (I’ll come back to that “was” through the week) a heavy drinker for thirty plus years. I guess I was or am a functioning alcoholic. If you call drinking 100 plus units a week functioning. For the sake of my health, my relationships and my overall happiness I have been trying get a handle on that problem for a long time. 2020 I managed to stop drinking during Covid for 2 months while locked down and separated from family overseas. Early 2021 the onset of another enforced separation due to the cutting of air travel did for me and I ended up in a bad state - I saw a psychiatrist, found an addiction counsellor and then found this place. I was anxious, depressed and frankly just exhausted. April 2022 I stepped out of my role at work - close to 29 years in the same business so not an easy transition. I have continued to plug away at sobriety and I am in a better place just now and got my first 100 days (71 I think was the prior record) just last week. That’s me and my journey to here. 

Alcohol is an insanely addictive drug. The first time I was shown a Jellinek curve - a map of the stages of addiction and recovery - I had a bunch of feelings. A sense of shame but then curiosity. It can be painful reading. If you can find one online it’s worth a look. It’s a clinical tool used in counseling. It moves through occasional relief drinking to constant relief drinking and finally to complete defeat and obsessive drinking in viscous circles. Other delights on the slide of misery include blackouts  and the loss of other interests. I wondered if the guy had followed me with a clipboard. Was he there when my efforts to control failed repeatedly or for the onset of long intoxications ? 

If you are here to get a break from alcohol for dry January then this type of model might seem a bit excessive. It is a map that many of us can identify with though as we chart our journey and our recovery. 

My simple point is this. Let us clearly understand that alcohol is a powerful and addictive drug. If it was otherwise dry January would be a walk in the park for the average drinker. Realism and understanding then is our first powerful mindset. 

For me a day at a time is front and center with that. I want to have a clean week for sure. Checking in today and every day with you lot - and just for today - that will get the job done until tomorrow and then we can meet again. In my head some days I think I should say I am giving up forever. I have learned that a day at a time is the right mindset for me. The idea of months and years of struggle overwhelms me. I double up on soft targets but I live my sober life a day at a time. 

A day at a time has got me this far this time. I am now after six months. So today’s final thank you is to you - for supporting me as I climb back up the other side of that curve one hopeful day at a time and for my 100 days. Thank you for committing to not drinking with me today and with each-other. IWNDWYT  sober friends ! Have beautiful and restful Sundays. If you need help or encouragement post on the main board and usually help is at at hand. As we check in today lets encourage each-other and take time to click those ups and welcome newcomers.

GeneralissimoMeowz,"Longtime lurker on this sub, but I finally have something to say. I'm writing this for anyone in their 20s who's recognized a drinking problem or has even admitted they are an alcoholic, but is having a hard time maintaining sobriety because of a lack of real consequences from their drinking. By real consequences I mean damage to your health/organs, DUI(s), loss of a job, loss of a relationship or home, etc. 

I was you, and your luck WILL run out. It's not a matter of if, but when. And if it's not directly from the alcohol itself, it very easily can be from the withdrawals as your addiction progresses.

I just turned 30 and a trip to the ER on Sunday is my wake-up call example. I apologize for the length.

TL;DR had a grand mal seizure while detoxing after my latest binge. If I weren't in the company of my father, I don't want to know what could have happened.

My drinking had gotten to the alcoholic level long before this awful past week. I've known I'm an alcoholic since I was 25, and the past 5 years have seen numerous stints of sobriety followed by progressively worse relapses.

I whiteknuckled 18 months after running into commercial property and leaving the scene, somehow avoiding DUI (plenty of other minor legal trouble but could have been so much worse). I've been lucky in that regard more times than I can count and never gotten one, though I'm definitely not proud of that.

I've had several 3-6 months runs of sobriety broken up by 3-6 day binges where the amount of liquor consumed in those sprees began to scare even me. But no ""real"" consequences from even the worst of my drinking. Though I left one arguably due to my drinking, I never lost a job. Never been homeless. I'm still married to the same beautiful woman I fell in love with 6 years ago (though I don't deserve her) and we have the most amazing baby girl. No DUIs, arrests, or jail time. Never hurt anyone (thank god).

And until this past weekend, no apparent real consequences to my health. That all changed this past weekend, and in my case it wasn't while I was drunk. It was the withdrawals.

Over the last 3-4 months I'd go about 30 days and fall into that same old binge pattern almost on cue. In the past my detox was nothing more than an inconvenience, but these withdrawals were growing more and more debilitating. What was once just a shaky, sweaty Sunday was becoming hours of violent vomiting and dry heaving to the point I thought my stomach was going to come out my throat. And this past Saturday night/Sunday morning became even worse. 

I knew the detox was going to be awful so I called upon the help and support of my dad, who at 15 years sober I'm so incredibly lucky to have. He picked me up from home and brought me to his house, where I commenced the violent vomiting and dry heaving for most of Saturday night. Once Sunday morning rolled around I thought I was past the worst of it, and was on to the cold sweats and headache.

Around 8am I sat down at the kitchen table to talk with my dad, who had just brought up his concern about the severity of my withdrawals, when he said I slowly started turning my head, staring off into space, and my left arm twitched heavily a couple of times.

A second later he said my jaw clenched tightly shut and my entire body shot out straight as a board, arms and legs completely stiff and the muscles in them hard as a rock. He kicked the chair out from under me and slowly guided my fall down to the floor where I proceeded to violently shake and foam at the mouth, eyes rolled to the back of my head, for the next 2.5 minutes, which must have seemed like an eternity to him. 

I remember nothing until opening my eyes and seeing my dad's face as he held my head in his lap, with a look on his face that will haunt me forever. I apparently asked who he was and what happened and he explained that I had just had a seizure and an ambulance was on the way. My dad thought he was watching his son die in his arms. 

I was taken to the ER where it was explained that I had had a grand mal seizure due to the alcohol withdrawal. After some IVs and a couple of hours of tests they let me go home under the direction that I cannot drive for 7 days. I was informed that if I drink again I'm almost certain to experience another seizure, and the likelihood of my withdrawals progressing to delirium tremens was very high.

This whole experience has scared the shit out of me. I'm enrolling in treatment this afternoon. To go from headaches to a seizure in a few relapses scares the absolute shit out of me.

And it should.

If my dad wasn't there and I was still at home alone who knows what could have happened. If I was in the shower or going down the stairs I could have been seriously injured or worse. If I was alone I could have choked on my own saliva and not had the chance to wake back up to this incredible life that I'm so fortunate hasn't been seriously damaged sooner. I could have left a 9 month old baby without a father and a wife without her husband. A father without his son.

I'm done. I have to be. There are no more chances. If I drink again there's a good chance I will fall into oblivion. 

So if you're young and struggling to stay sober because alcohol hasn't REALLY messed your life up, please know that your luck will run out in one way or another. If you're lucky enough to avoid the DUIs and jail time, it will be your health that it takes.

It could be your life. If not from organ failure, then from the withdrawals.

Please don't drink with me today. There is nothing to gain from taking that first drink, but everything to lose. Wish me luck in this new chapter of sobriety.

P.S. - thank you all for your inspiring and helpful posts over the years. They've made all the difference in times of need, I hope someone out there can relate to my experience.

EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words of encouragement and support!! It really means so much in a time like this to know how many of you are out there facing the same battles every day. Although I hate seeing how many people are all too familiar with the pains of withdrawal, I'm so happy that my story helped even one of you from taking the first drink today. I wanted to elaborate a little more on the amounts I was drinking since it seems like a lot of people can relate to my patterns..

From basically 23-26 I was a daily if not almost daily drinker, where the amounts progressed from a few beers a night, to a few mixed drinks, to 1-2 pints of vodka per day for about 18 months, until I got sober for the first time. I drank to self-medicate, numb the pain of anxiety and depression, and then it became drinking simply to relieve the physical and mental torture that stopping produced.

I could only last a few hours near the end of that period without taking at least a shot to stop the hurt. Then I messed up, realized my problem was a danger to others, and got ""sober"" for 18 months (during which time I self-medicated with any other substance I could get my hands on).

The last 3 years have basically been short/medium periods of true sobriety with more and more dangerous relapses (continuous binge drinking for days on end until stopping cold turkey and suffering the consequences). The last 12 months I have been on and off benzos for anxiety, which I am certain played a role in each relapse, and certainly added to this most recent withdrawal nightmare. 

This most recent binge was about 6 straight days of 1+L vodka or whiskey per day, until taking my last drink Saturday afternoon, and suffering a seizure Sunday morning around 8am. 

I'm sure the amounts at which withdrawals become dangerous vary greatly from person to person. I realize that stopping cold turkey can be insanely dangerous, which is pretty much why I made this post. To show people that you might get away with it, or with minimal physical consequences, for a long time. 

But one day you won't. 

Thank you all so much for your support. I'm beginning out-patient treatment Monday.


EDIT: Quoting u/hyperfat's comment: 

A little bit of a PSA, please anyone who is trying to quit cold turkey after years of chronic alcoholism, please please consult a clinic on how to proceed safely. 

Alcohol withdrawal is one of the only withdrawals you can die from. DEAD.

if you start shaking, heart beating irregular, really bad sweats, and delirium, vomiting where you cant hold down any liquid, hallucinations, this is a big heads up you need to see a clinic or doctor on meds or supervised detox.",2020-11-25 22:44:56,Unknown,290,k0w87w,1658,StopDrinking,Alcohol withdrawals are NO JOKE,0.99
Rich-Goat2204,"First post here, December 4th 2022 was my last day drinking. I had gotten to the point where I couldn’t stop without shakes, jaw lock, and the worst part severe anxiety. I was drinking  at least 2 10% tall boys when I’d wake up, bring 3 or 4 more with me to work and sometimes I’d even go to a near store to get more during work. I fell asleep working multiple times even once when I was doing a return for a customer (I was a lead where I worked). I lied my way out of many what should have been firings, and all around was in the darkest place of my life.

What started as a one off thing with my gf became a tool we’d use to relax which quickly became a habit and a few months later I was dependent. The thing I’ve learned about alcohol is it’s incredibly deceitful and patient. I manipulated for years to make sure there was always vodka. Things got so bad and abusive I left the state to stay at my brothers. There was no way I’d be sober now if I didn’t leave. Even then, from the second I got here I was drinking, this continued a little over a year. Then I finally got to the point where I just told my store manager (she is an amazing person). She genuinely cares and made sure I went to the ER with no exceptions. I went, they gave me a week prescription for a drug to stop the seizures and anxiety. I followed the taper plan and was clean for the first time in over 5 years.

Then I started focusing on my health (both mental and physical) I told my coworkers the truth of course they all already knew (apparently I wasn’t as clever as drunk me thought). I’m back to who I really am and the difference is so drastic we started using a different name to reference the old stories. I even got a promotion at a new store to assistant manager. Life’s a million times better now. Still have to finish my fines to get my license but that’ll be finished soon too.

TITLE: People With A.D.H.D. Are Likely to Die Significantly Earlier Than Their Peers, Study Finds

SUBTITLE: A large study found that men lost seven years of life expectancy and women lost nine years, compared with counterparts without the disorder.

AUTHOR: Ellen Barry
TIME: Jan. 23, 2025, 3:00 a.m. ET

A study of more than 30,000 British adults diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D., found that, on average, they were dying earlier than their counterparts in the general population — around seven years earlier for men, and around nine for women.

The study, which was published Thursday in The British Journal of Psychiatry, is believed to be the first to use all-cause mortality data to estimate life expectancy in people with A.D.H.D. Previous studies have pointed to an array of risks associated with the condition, among them poverty, mental health disorders, smoking and substance abuse.

The authors cautioned that A.D.H.D. is substantially underdiagnosed and that the people in their study — most of them diagnosed as young adults — might be among the more severely affected. Still, they described their findings as “extremely concerning,” highlighting unmet needs that “require urgent attention.”

“It’s a big number, and it is worrying,” said Joshua Stott, a professor of aging and clinical psychology at University College London and an author of the study. “I see it as likely to be more about health inequality than anything else. But it’s quite a big health inequality.”

The study did not identify causes of early death among people with A.D.H.D. but found that they were twice as likely as the general population to smoke or abuse alcohol and that they had far higher rates of autism, self-harming behaviors and personality disorders than the general population. In adulthood, Dr. Stott said, “they find it harder to manage impulses, and have more risky behaviors.”

beatadhd,"So there was that awesome [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ifsln9/lets_share_lifechanging_adhd_tips_that_weve/?sort=top) with a bunch of ADHD'ers sharing **real tips** that have changed their life.

I thought it was a great change from most advice on the internet which is written by non-ADHD'ers (and it's painfully obvious that it is).

I read through the 700+ comments and paraphrased, merged and categorised all the tips.

&#x200B;

The 131 tips are split into the following categories:

* General
* Cleaning
* Memory
* Time Blindness
* Distractions
* Getting Things Done
* Emotional Dysregulation
* Sleep
* Relationships
* Work
* School
* Executive Function
* Nutrition/Medication

# General

* Pack things the day before so you don’t forget \~ **(**u/digi-cow**)**
* Don’t drink alcohol. Causes brain fog and it can negatively interact with medications. Alcohol can even cause ADHD-like symptoms in non-ADHD people \~ **(**u/HiTechTek**,** u/beatadhd)
* Do Cardio before you need to do stuff that requires sitting. It helps you focus. \~ **(**u/robertaloblaw**,** u/beatadhd)
* Use text-to-speech generators to help you read webpages/books \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**)**
* Keep things at eye level (Especially notes/todo lists) \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Be stupidly early to places just in case you forget something \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Stretch once in awhile. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Take a deep breath. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Take a cold shower in the morning or turn it cold just for 30-60 seconds at the end of your shower. Wakes you up, gets your blood flowing and gets you out of the shower. \~ **(**u/Juan_Creamsicle**,** u/beatadhd)
* Get a therapist if you can. \~ **(**u/fineandnormal**)**
* If you aren’t diagnosed: Actually get a diagnosis and a therapeutic programme that works for you. Don’t spend more time wondering - you’ll still feel like an imposter afterwards, don’t worry… \~ **(**u/Little_Blue_Shed**)**
* Most important for me has been telling myself all I need to do is floss. Usually you'll end up chaining the rest of your night routine tasks like brushing onto that. \~ **(**u/amazona_auropalliata**)**
* Buy a whiteboard to sketch out things when your mind starts going into overdrive. \~ **(**u/bkmilli**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Enjoy the journey more than the destination, don’t be in a hurry to finish something you are doing, but always at least do something small everyday. Life is not a race, rather, it is an accumulation of smaller improvements to oneself. \~ **(**u/ksettle**)**  
>  
>*People are in such a rush these days… You can’t expect to become a superhuman overnight. Focus on sustainability first and enjoy the journey.*

# Cleaning

* Have a designated spot for every single item (Put it in the same place every time) \~ **(**u/BrownShoeJenny**)**
* Have a “misc” basket in each room. If you’re truly unable to put something away, put it in the basket. Have a designated period of time, once a week, when your sole priority is to put everything away, all at once. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Whenever you lose something that you “put away,” start keeping it in the first place you looked for it. \~ **(**u/FullDisclosureDaemon**)**
* In order to not get overwhelmed when cleaning, remember there are only 5 things you need to tackle: Trash, Laundry, Dishes, Putting things back that have a place, Put things in a pile that don’t have a place. \~ **(**u/mmc09**)**
* If you’re moving from one room to another, take the item with you that needs to go to the other room. It’s already on your way and it’s one less thing cluttering your room. \~ **(**u/SweetTeaBags**)**
* If you can afford it: Get a cleaning person; It takes them 3 hours to do what you can do in 3 weeks. While they are there, use them as an accountability buddy and sort out your misc tasks like paying bills. \~ **(**u/swarleyknope**)**
* Embrace chaos. Let your brain get distracted when you’re cleaning. Cleaning dishes and stop spare trash? It’s fine go clean that and then get back to the dishes \~ **(**u/DobbythehouseElff**)**
* Have a dedicated playlist for cleaning. High tempo songs help keep you moving. \~ **(**u/DobbythehouseElff**)**
* Do chores before you go to bed. No matter what your routine is, you have to go to bed at some point. You can “habit-chain” cleaning into going to bed. \~ **(**u/bkmilli**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Listen to podcasts/audiobooks when doing chores. My excitement to listen to a new episode of my favorite podcast motivates me to do boring stuff like dishes or laundry. (I personally listen to podcasts) \~ **(**u/dani-tp**)**  
>  
>*Cleaning became so easy once I started using a “side” to stimulate my brain. I’m mostly watching TV shows when I clean right now (this also works for cooking!) .*

# Memory

* Having a tablet like an iPad Pro is helpful for keeping colorful notes. Avoids issues losing notebooks \~ **(**u/zombiessalad**)**
* Park in the same place every time when you go to a common place. You won’t forget where you park that way \~ **(**u/gibbousboi**)**
* Keep a spare house key in your car and one outside your house. \~ **(**u/GoodGuyVik**)**
* Keep important items in visible and convenient locations. e.g: Take pills when you eat? Keep your bottle beside your table where you eat. \~ **(**u/girlabout2fallasleep**)**
* Get a Tile. Bluetooth GPS trackers that are a game changer for ADHD people that lose keys/wallets. \~ **(**u/fizzzzzpop**)**
* Tape your most often made recipes to the inside of your kitchen cabinet doors. \~ **(Unknown)**
* Three point check when you close the front door: Phone, wallet, keys \~ **(**u/cowboyhugbees**)**
* Use voice assistants. “Remind me to do X tomorrow at Y time” \~ **(**u/theviciousfish**)**
* Use the mind palace memory exercise to help solve retention issues. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Keep forgetting your lunch? Put your keys on it. That way you can’t leave without your lunch \~ **(**u/Therealdickbut**,** u/Maktube, u/mismanager)
* If you need to remember to bring something with you the next day, place it right in front of the exit door so you HAVE to touch it before you leave the house. If it’s something in the fridge, put a sticky note on the exit door’s handle. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Buy multiple items that you use often. Setup multiple chargers at work/home (so you have a spare if you lose one). e.g. buy 10 different lip balms so you can always find it when you need it. \~ **(**u/redbananass**)**
* Have convenient, labeled spaces for things. It’s hard to forget your phone when you ALWAYS put it beside your charger. (Use a cheap labelmaker!) \~ **(**u/TotallyLegitEstoc**,** u/nathanb131)
* Get a tracking tool like Tile and put it on things you lose regularly. (Keys/Wallet) \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Have rules for placement of the important things in your life. (it’s too hard to do it for everything) \~ **(**u/nathanb131**)**
* Create a second brain for yourself - in whatever way is most appealing to you. (I personally use Notion) \~ (u/significanttoday**)**
* If you want to remember something, put an object out-of-place whilst thinking about what you want to remember. \~ **(**u/VectorGambiteer**)**
* Count your steps as you walk into a new room. It’ll help you remember why you entered that room. It gives you something to focus on but it’s not too much that you’ll get distracted. (This is similar to many forms of counting meditations too) \~ **(**u/bethknowsbest**)**
* Use a bowl to throw your keys, badges, and wallet into when you get home. That way you can’t leave without ALL the stuff you need. \~ **(**u/pockunit**)**
* ALWAYS have a bag with the essentials. On mine a have my keys, charger, papers and even tooth brush. If I’m going out, I do not waste time searching for everything. Just search for a bag. \~ **(**u/sdjrp**)**
* Make a calendar entry for every scheduled thing religiously unless it’s routine like a 9-5 job. Make the calendar entry immediately while making the appointment. Do this for parties, birthdays, dates, finals, med refills, trash night, etc. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Use Spaced Repetition to study for your exams, remember things about people in your life, and literally everything you can possibly make a flashcard for. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**  
>  
>*Is it narcisstic to put my own tip as a favourite? Well who cares, it works! Spaced repetition is fantastic and honestly* ***feels like cheating***\*. There are a lot of free tools out there which work great. I’m currently using my own private tool\* 😉

# Time Blindness

* Set your phone clock 10-15 mins fast on purpose \~ **(**u/Anonredditthoughts**)**
* Put appointments in your calendar 10-20 minutes earlier than the actual appointment \~ **(**u/Alyscupcakes**)**
* A schedule is only as good as the alarms and info you put in \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Set timers for activites you hyperfocus on. BUT set the timer for X minutes less than the task takes. (Give yourself time to wrap up whatever you’re working on) Additional Protip: Use this on a watch rather than your phone to avoid getting distracted. A basic watch/smart watch will save your life. \~ **(**u/dinamyte519**)**
* Download an app on your phone that chimes and buzzes every half an hour during your awake time. Keeps you aware of how much time has passed. \~ **(**u/Frosty172**)**
* Track your time. Every morning, write out a todo list by hand and track the time taken for each task. (Write down the time whenever you take a break or switch tasks) - I personally use Toggl to track my time \~ **(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Get an electric toothbrush with a timer. ADHD people have time blindness and it’ll make sure you brush for at least two minutes. \~ **(**u/insaxon**)**  
>  
>*Yes. Two minutes can feel like two hours for me. Or I’ll brush for 20 seconds and think five minutes has passed. I can’t trust my brain, so I started using an electric toothbrush with a timer*

# Distractions

* Disable all your notifications on your phone except for essential apps (Texting, Voicemail, Calendar) \~ **(**u/kee_kee**)**
* Use website blockers for distracting websites *(I use Cold Turkey, Freedom and News Feed removers for social media + Youtube)* \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**)**
* Get a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones + non-distracting music/audio \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**,** u/michaeltheobnoxious)
* If you can’t stop yourself from answering that text/email/IM right away but don’t actually have time to deal with it, tell the person you’ll respond when you get a minute. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Your brain focuses better after some exercise. *Cardio works best* \~ **(**u/unofficialuser112**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Use a noise-cancelling headset and listen to music/white noise/brown noise. Enables hyperfocus and blocks out distractions (“I don’t regret getting diagnosed late, but I do regret getting noise cancelling headphones that late in life.”) \~ **(**u/rn7889**)**  
>  
>*Stop scrolling right now and go buy the noise-cancelling headset. A noise-cancelling headset + some noise like music/brown noise is essential if you have ADHD. Feel free to thank me later once your life changes.*  
>  
>*If the headset isn't in your budget: Brown noise + earphones will get you 80% of the way there.*

# Getting Things Done

* If you have an Android: Put a widget from your todo list app on your home screen so it’s the first thing you see \~ **(**u/kee_kee**)**
* Break tasks down into as many smaller tasks as you need for it to feel manageable. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Learn to plan around transitions. It’s easier to start things if you chain them with another task that is ending. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Use the pomodoro technique for everything. It’s great having a break to look forward to. \~ **(**u/ontapeina_sthrnaccnt**)**
* Remember that something is better than nothing. If you only get 26% of a task done then it’s further than if you never started. It’s better to do little bits of every task rather than procrastinating. \~ **(**u/xxxistentialist**)**
* Attach numbers to events. e.g: Going to bed (3) - Brush, Floss, Mouthwash. \~ **(**u/Frosty172**)**
* Lie to yourself. I’ll tell myself that I’m just going to unload one dish from the dishwasher. Once I’ve started, I’ll at least unload a few, and maybe clean the whole kitchen. \~ **(**u/coffeeclichehere**)**
* Decide what you’re going to do each day beforehand, preferably while your meds are at their workingest. Make sure it’s only 1 thing. \~ **(**u/optimisticaspie**)**
* Understand that FUTURE YOU IS STILL YOU. If you think you’ll do something later, understand that future you is still you. Future you isn’t more likely to muster up the desire to do the work. f you don’t have the motivation to do it in the next 24 hours then future you probably won’t either. \~ **(**u/Moon_In_Scorpio**)**
* When you need to transition between tasks, pretend that you are talking to a friend who is having issues with something. Give yourself a nudge and remind yourself it’s time to switch tasks/get started. (Detach yourself from the task) \~ **(**u/Gerryislandgirl**)**
* When you take breaks, make sure your break isn’t too interesting. That way you won’t get absorbed in your break. Just clean during your break or something like that. \~ **(**u/Treppenwitz_shitz**)**
* Gamify things and set a limited amount of time to accomplish something. e.g: Brew your coffee and get as many chores done as you can before the coffee is finished brewing. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**
* Write TODO lists as a brain dump. And then order them in importance or the order you want to do them in. That way you don’t pause while writing down tasks. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**
* Don’t be afraid to stimulate yourself if you need it. Listen to a podcast or music to get yourself to do something. \~ **(**u/fineandnormal**)**
* Reward yourself when you get things done. Positive Reinforcement is good and you’ll feel like getting more things done. \~ **(**u/prince-ali-but-short**)**
* Change your environment and work from a place where there are fewer distractions. e.g: Cafe/library. You’ll get more stuff done \~ **(**u/humbled_lightbringer**)**
* Set a time to do work, and a time to relax; that way you don’t feel guilty about relaxing during the time you set aside for yourself. \~ **(**u/talking_face**)**
* Change your alarm sounds/timer sounds frequently, but use alarms and timers as much as possible. \~ **(**u/Little_Blue_Shed**)**
* Treat timers and alarms like non-negotiable laws. When the timer goes off, doesn’t matter what you were doing seconds ago, it’s time to go. Half showered, wet hair, one eye done, whatever it is, you’re out the door. \~ **(Unknown)**

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Body doubling - if you need to do some work that requires focus without much fun, have someone in the room with you. They could be working too, or not. Just having them there makes everything just a little more interesting and a little more accountable. \~ **(**u/Creebjeez**)**  
>  
>*I feel like a lot of people are missing some sort of accountability system in their lives. I don’t do body doubling but I use Beeminder to keep me accountable.*

# Emotional Dysregulation

* Brain dump in a notebook by your bed every night. \~ **(**u/ALyscupcakes**)**
* Don’t feel bad about sucking at school/work. You’ll get better as you learn more strategies for coping with ADHD. Things get better \~ **(**u/astrozork321**)**
* Use writing/journaling as cognitive therapy to defuse emotional history \~ **(**u/Tman1307**)**
* Remind yourself that the world won’t end if a few things fall behind. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Write a reverse todo-list. Write down the things you have accomplished for the day. That way you won’t feel overwhelmed and it’ll make you feel better. \~ **(**u/SuspiciousEchidna**)**
* You’re allowed to let things go. Forget irrelevant things and forgive yourself. Ignore the awkward thing you did last week. Life will move on. \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**,** u/optimisticaspie)
* Forgive yourself for your limits. \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Meditation. Active breaks for people that struggle to take breaks. Use a meditation app when you’re starting. Like Headspace \~ **(**u/Juan_Creamsicle**)**
* Start working on letting go of shame. It depresses your motivation and only makes things worse. You wouldn’t shame someone in a wheelchair for not getting things done, your difficulty is in your brain instead of your legs but it’s no less real. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**
* Cognitive Behavioural Therapy + meditation **\~ (**u/beatadhd**)**

>**🌟 My Favourite:** You’re allowed to let things go. Forget irrelevant things and forgive yourself. Ignore the awkward thing you did last week. Life will move on. \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**,** u/optimisticaspie)  
>  
>*Stop hating yourself. Don’t look at the future. Don’t look at the past. Look at the present. I used to always hate myself for being so unproductive. I realised how pointless that was and I started to focus on improving myself in the* ***present.***

# Sleep

* Put your phone on the other side of the room and make your alarm super loud. Gets you out off bed and will make you turn it off so you don’t wake other people up. \~ **(**u/Valendr0s**)**
* If you’re having trouble getting out of bed then set a timer on your phone for 5 minutes and chuck it across the room. It’ll force you to get up and turn it off. \~ **(**u/PMDicksInTinyClothes**)**
* Buy 2 bright lamps and 2 timers. Set them up to turn on automatically 5-15min before you want your alarm to go off in the morning. The lights help your body know its daytime \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Change your thermostat so the temperature goes down an hour before bedtime and gets warmer 30 minutes before you wake up. The cooler temperatures get your body to sleep and the warmer temperatures help you wake up \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Use a reminder app for starting your bedtime routine, not just your bedtime. (And have a bedtime routine) \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Try setup meetings/commitments early in the morning. They'll force you to get out of bed \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Set two alarms when you get up in the morning. One to get out of bed and one for your medication. e.g: 5:30 AM wake up and take medication and then fall back to bed. By your 6AM alarm you’ll have waken up and your meds will have kicked in \~ **(**u/BizzarduousTask**)**  
>  
>*What a great lifehack.* *I’ve been doing this the past few days (except I don’t wake up at 6AM) - it works pretty well. Also I throw my phone on the other side of the room so it forces me to get out of bed.*

# Relationships

* It’s okay to be in a room with people and just let people breathe. You don’t need to fill the silence. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* When having a conversation or learning something, repeat every word the person says in your head. It’ll help you not drift off as much. It also makes it so you’ll interrupt people less. \~ **(**u/TheNocturne**)**
* Try to avoid the word 'but' when faced with a conflict. Instead try be constructive towards arguments/discussions with the word 'and'. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** For maintaining eye contact: Imagine a red dot on someone’s nose for intense focus. Bridge of the nose for paying attention. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**  
>  
>*Haven’t tried this one but I used to have trouble with eye contact a few years ago so this stood out to me. I’m pretty good with eye contact now, but I’ll be trying it over the next few weeks anyway.*

# Work

* If you hate your job. Make a job switch. It’ll help you make positive changes in your life. \~ **(**u/Mooberry_**)**
* Find a job that works WITH your system. If you can’t wake up and be functional in the morning then stop trying. Find a job that doesn’t need you to wake up in the morning. Stop beating yourself up over things your brains isn’t designed for \~ **(**u/obxunseeker**)**
* Be self-employed and start a business. “No matter where I worked or what I did, I was constantly watching the clock, hating every single second of it. On Saturday I worked 27 straight hours to finish a job on time and it was still less painful than working an 8 hour shift as an employee. Those 27 hours disappeared and left me feeling gratified because I made someone’s house beautiful and I got to see how happy I made her the first time she saw her new home.” \~ (u/jake7697**)**
* When promising a timescale to a client, double or triple the amount of time that you initially think it will take. That way worst case scenario, you will finish it on deadline and meet expectations or best case, finish before and exceed expectations. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* The moment you know you aren’t going to make a deadline, let the client know and again give them an overestimate of time for new deadline. People are always understanding and appreciative for this quick communication. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Reply to emails and messages when you read them. 99% of the time, days and weeks will go by if you tell yourself that you’ll reply later on… \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Be honest about your limitations and own your shit. Most people have no idea how much adhd affects so many things and therefore can’t understand our inability to do basic things at times. Especially if you come across as smart and creative, they can misplace our struggles for laziness and lack of care. If you fuck up own it, explain why and apologise. It doesn’t have to be long winded but it is important to state how you aim to rectify the situation and again. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Stop comparing your output and motivation to others and embrace a slower, more considered, creative one. You are not other people. You are you. Trying to jam your freeform, 12 sided shape into the round hole is painful and won’t work. You don’t need a hole, you need self acceptance. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Learn to say no to taking on things that you know may cause you stress and excess pressure just because it’s money. It is not worth it, just put the boundaries that will save your mental health in the first place and you won’t have to deal with the fallout later. The more you do it, the easier it becomes. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**  
>  
>*God yes… ADHD people have a dangerous habit of overcommitting to stuff. Personally I think I just forget that I’m already working on X, Y and Z. Sustainability is important - don’t overcommit.*

# School

* Use Active Recall + Spaced Repetition to study for all your exams. I've seen countless people go from C's to straight A's after adopting them \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* If you're finding it difficult to start assignments early then ONLY read + annotate the assignment brief early and go take a break after that. Your subconscious should process the information and it'll be easier to start later on. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* It’s better to turn in an assignment that is 75% done. It’ll drag your grades down less than if you never turned it in \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**)**
* Print out lectures and powerpoints in advance (ask the teacher for them). That way you won’t need to listen and write at the same time. You can annotate the printed versions instead. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Visit your school's inclusivity and disability team. They will hopefully have policies for helping people with ADHD \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**  
>  
>*This is something I never took advantage of while at University, but I probably should have. A few assignment extensions when my meds stopped working would have saved me from countless all nighters…*

# Executive Function

* Setup a morning routine + a reset routine. A reset routine is something you do when you're feeling super unfocused. Mine consists of meditation, exercise, journaling, playing music and making some tea. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* If it takes less than ten minutes to do the task, just do it immediately. \~ **(**u/Zzazu**)**
* Have a uniform for work, social and casual scenarios. Don’t mix your work clothes with your casual clothes. \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* If you start to feel frustrated for no reason, eat something and keep yourself hydrated. (Self-care flowchart) \~ (u/enjakuro)
* it’s better to half-ass most things than it is to not do them at all. \~ **(**u/coffeclichehere**)**
* Set alarms using music rather than the default alarm sounds. It’ll help you get going. (And music releases norepinephrine in your brain!) \~ **(**u/redditraptor6**)**
* Make yourself kits for common repeated household tasks. e.g: Cleaning Kit, Package mailing kit… Reduces the friction needed to get started on a task \~ **(**u/sonjavalentine**)**
* Refine your routine and rituals to reduce the overall time it takes to get them ready. Reduce the friction needed to start your morning routine. e.g: Prepare a filled pot of coffee the night before. \~ **(**u/lazyoracle**)**
* Set just a few non-negotiable standards and laws for yourself. Pick those that improve your life the most. e.g: No phone in bed at night or in the morning. Not even a quick email check. And read your goals every morning. \~ **(**u/AllsFarrin**)**
* When you’re trying to get started on a task: Write down the steps you’ve already done and the steps you plan to do next. Helps a lot with spaghetti thoughts \~ **(**u/qui_gone_Gym**)**
* Drink a big glass of water when you know you are going to have to start doing a thing in a bit. When you inevitably have to go pee, start after you wash your hands. You are already up and your brain already had to switch gears. Use it as momentum. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** On tough days. Use the 1-thing theory. Just try and accomplish just one-thing for that day. e.g. Clean the kitchen. \~ **(**u/soggysocks63**,** u/GoodGuyVik)  
>  
>*A bit less life-hacky compared to the others but I’ve found that getting started is a lot easier when you only have a single priority.*

# Nutrition/Medication

* If you are Vitamin D deficient then take Vitamin D supplements (see a doctor first). It’ll help your mood and energy levels. \~ **(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**
* Eat lots of protein and stay hydrated. \~ **(**u/chlordane_zero**)**
* Figure out if you're deficient in anything and try fix those things. This includes getting a food allergy test, figuring out deficiencies and eating a healthy diet. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

“I have a neurodevelopmental condition that affects my brains ability to do executive functioning, which basically means that things like planning, organization, impulse control, task initiation, short-term memory, sustained focus, self-motivation and time management are more difficult for me which can affect my daily life, which requires these skills. My prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for a lot of this and higher functions is likely smaller than average and would likely show less activity on a brain scan. People with this disorder typically have brains that are 3 years behind in development in relation to their peers in certain aspects. 

 A big component to this disorder is dysregulation of the central nervous system and has even been found to be frequently comorbid with other disorders such as sleep disorders which can compound on this. Though we don’t know exactly what is going on in every case I likely have lower-than-normal levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, responsible for many many functions, including the ones affected by this condition. Possibly serotonin and/or norepinephrine as well.

 A large impairment is inability to REGULATE ones focus. It’s not so much about complete lack per say that someone with this can focus sometimes but has difficulty choosing when or for what. They may try to start a task only to quickly get distracted on something else completely irrelevant, and may end up focusing on that instead. I can focus for a long time sometimes on something that is interesting but not so important, but when I need to sit down and do something unstimulating, say, paperwork, a combination of poor impulse control, racing thoughts, low frustration tolerance and high distractability means that I might struggle more significantly than the average person who might not like doing it, but can just buckle down and “get er’ done” when needed. Sometimes it is the opposite, where I focus too much to the point of not being able to stop/redirect it, despite it being more convenient to do so. Some may also hop from task to task as they have new thoughts to distract them on to something else, forgetting what they were originally doing. This is no more controllable than a person with OCD controls their compulsions, although there are strategies to help cope and work around ones deficits in order to succeed. 

Not exclusive but common to this disorder is dysregulation of emotions as well. This is not as well known, but when I am angry, I RAGE, when I am sad, my entire world crashes down around me. When I am happy, I am EXCITED and BURSTING WITH ENERGY. The emotional roller coaster in itself is exhausting, and for those that especially struggle with the poor impulse control aspect, it can get them in trouble. 

Speaking of that, it is estimated that nearly a quarter of the prison population has this disorder, despite it only effecting about 4% of the general population. That’s a huge difference. That’s not to say that having this MAKES one a criminal: we all choose our path in life. But some of the traits associated with it: impulsivity and hyperactivity, increased risk-taking  (mixed in with the wrong environment and bad influences/choices) can certainly make things worse, and predispose the wrong (or right I guess) person to that kind of lifestyle. 

Having this disorder also can predispose you to having substance use or abuse issues. People with this are hugely overrepresented among addicts, with this disorder being 5 to 10 times more prevalent amongst alcoholics than the general population. Poor impulse control and higher risk-taking/novelty-seeking behaviour, can contribute, as well “self-medication” to try to deal with the symptoms of this disorder. Many claim that their drink or puff or what-have-you will “slow them down” enough to be able to focus, although clearly this maladaptive coping strategy comes with many consequences, and the actual vs. perceived benefit seems… questionable. Also common is binge eating, smoking, excessive caffeine intake (caffeine and nicotine are stimulants, albeit mild ones that have shown some benefit for treating the symptoms of this disorder) and impulse shopping/difficulty with managing finances. 

People with this disorder are nearly twice to three times as likely to get into a vehicle accident than people without. 

This disorder is highly comorbid or a common cause of secondary anxiety and/or depression. Struggling with this untreated can make the person depressed because they feel that no matter how hard they try, they are still having more difficulty than the people around them, and may not be doing as well at school or work as they want to, which causes a huge blow to the self-esteem. They may blurt things out in conversations or have struggles socializing, (though not nearly to the degree or in the same ways as autism) sometimes seeming “weird” to others, which can lead to judgement and social rejection, hurting their self-esteem and confidence further. They may begin to see themselves as stupid, lazy, or crazy. Children growing up with this condition are estimated to receive about 20,000 more negative messages from others, due to the symptoms they display which may be misunderstood by others, by age 10. Many adults with the disorder report feeling like they are dissatisfied and lost in life and unable to utilize their full potential. Once the main cause (the primary disorder) is treated, the “depression” tends to go away. It can also cause anxiety due to constant worrying of what they might forget next, due to the short term memory issues, or how they might mess up, especially if they have been heavily criticized in the past for their symptoms, which can be seen as “laziness” or “lack of discipline” by the general population. Many report having what could be described as a whirlwind of racing thoughts that never seem to stop and make it incredibly hard to concentrate. Anxiety can also be used as a (poor, if I do say so myself) coping mechanism, as the rush of adrenaline and cortisol associated with (say) being about to miss a deadline may be able to temporarily compensate for the lack of dopamine that is thought to impede their ability to focus. Basically sending them into fight or flight just so they panic and complete the task. This is how some people with the disorder learn to function: by being stressed all the time, or even OVERLY organized and neurotic in an OCD-like way in order to overcompensate and try to stay on top of their symptoms and calm the mess in their head. (Though certainly a lot don’t or would struggle too much to even develop this way of coping in particular) 

Wait! But there’s good news. There’s a treatment that’s been studied for a long time, proven relatively safe for MOST healthy people at prescribed therapeutic dosages, has actually been proven to calm hyperactivity and/or racing thoughts, LOWER rates of addiction and substance misuse amongst the treated despite being a pill and is usually not addicting to those who actually need it and take it as directed, (the problem is remembering to take it lol) lowers the risk of driving accidents to about normal, increases dopamine levels and activity in the prefrontal cortex, allowing people with the disorder to function much more normally, decreases impulsivity and may even help with emotional regulation for some people. Can even calm anxiety IF the anxiety was stemming from their untreated disorder symptoms, despite being typically contraindicated for anxiety disorders.”

Now you tell them it’s ADHD

Them: Oh so like you can’t sit still or something? Only kids have that lol. Can’t believe they’re giving bAsIcAlLy MɛTh to treat this fake “disorder” lol. Back in my day we used belts and no one had this problem.

maximumpotential245,"Bf tried breaking up six times in the last three months. He is still not 100% sure if he wants to break up. Whenever his anxiety/doubts kick in (that this relationship is wrong and he is bored), he comes off very strongly and tries very hard to break up. He believes he has ADHD.

He has told me that he doesn't like the person he is in this relationship. He doesn't want that he has so much power in this relationship, and he doesn't feel like an equal relationship.  I grew up simply, and he didn't, and he thinks that my very calm, composed, and quiet nature (not very excitable personality) is fundamentally different from his. He thinks there is a wall of boredom between us that doesn't let him open up to have any meaningful conversation with me. When he talks to his friends, who can effortlessly switch conversations and talk about deep things, he is reminded of how much boredom he feels talking to me, and his brain latches onto that. And how talking to me feels like work.

He thinks that I am content with how I am, whereas he needs constant stimulation. He doesn't feel challenged due to that. He gets very bored explaining things, so the conversation for him feels one-sided. He feels like he is rotting in the apartment when we hang out and have boring meaningless conversations. Moreover, he thinks that I don't have any personality. I only try to talk about things that are of interest to him, but I don't bring anything to the table. He doesn't think I have many interests, opinions, or passions.He said he doesn't care much about this relationship and is almost over it. He tries so hard to feel feelings for me, but he fails. He feels lectured by the way I speak to him, and sometimes when he is on my chest, the way I caress him reminds him of the warmth of his grandmother. Me not pushing him or keeping him accountable gives him maternal vibes.

He acknowledges that I have positive values such as kindness, care, hard work, thoughtfulness, curiosity, etc. Rather, he says he has never met anyone with a heart as gold as mine.  But his brain latches onto only the negatives which he believes that I can't connect knowledge and I don't think logically, am not very smart, often fail to answer with logic and reasoning, and I speak very fast and skip all the important parts of the conversation. I can't connect my knowledge, and hence he is unable to have deep conversations with me. His brain is looking for evidence to figure me out, and his brain is subconsciously doing a fact check every time I say anything

\*\*TLDR:\*\*My boyfriend struggles to be into me because our relationship is too easy and comfortable, which makes him super bored. He would like someone who is edgy, fun, and full of banter, with whom he can have deep, intellectual conversations and especially who can challenge him, who has a lot of interests, passions, etc. He thinks that since he had a traumatic childhood, it is hard for him to value the warmth and care that I bring. And, his brain latches onto the missing intellectual compatibility

**Other relevant info**

He is potentially gifted, and hence there may be a real issue of intellectual incompatibility and a personality incompatibility as in the way I converse, which according to him, is without banter and humor. I am not all over the place like him.

He has many mental health issues that he thinks have nothing to do with the relationship. On the other hand, I find that since he has stopped taking antidepressants, these thoughts about whether this relationship is right for him or not have been obsessively bothering him. We have intellectual incompatibility, but I feel like I bring a lot to the table that seems to be getting ignored. I have been fighting to work through it until he parses out whether this is the relationship or the mental health, some relationship OCD. He is potentially gifted with a very high IQ and gets bored quickly. He is a perfectionist too. He denies having relationship OCD, but he thinks it may be due to ADHD. He used to take Adderall and antidepressants, but he stopped. He started feeling depressed, so started Adderall back. I know that he hates the idea of being tied down as well. He does accept that he has felt boredom in every relationship in the past. Still, he thinks it is a combination of my intellectual incompatibility and his need for novelty due to his ADHD brain. He is 30, I am 34, and we have been dating for almost 20 months.

Another thing is that he doesn't feel much love for his partner. He has said that in any relationship he has been in, he has only seen glimpses of love here and there. He tries really hard that those feeling to stay, but they are very fleeting. So when he doesn't feel feelings, boredom is extra hard on him

I think the reason he was able to be so honest was that I asked a lot of questions whenever I see him boiling with anxiety. He always says if you dig dirt, you will find dirt. And maybe I am making this difficult for him by not accepting it amicably. And What I mean by not accepting amicably is that I would say NO, we are not breaking up. You promised to work on yourself with therapy to identify the issue. So please do take at least three therapy sessions before you break up. I genuinely think that he does feel bad to drag me through the mud and take me on a rollercoaster, and that is why he has left a decision to me. Currently, he says he will go to a therapist and try to make this work where he can come around to being comfortable with stability over excitability, but he has almost no hopes. He has come to think that he may also have some avoidant attachment issues.

He wants to try this relationship a bit more because he doesn't want to lose me, but he is not available for me at this time. He has almost no hopes that this will change.

**My perspective:** I just want to add more details on how I think: He is never physically abusive, and I know he can never be. I think he is coming off more strongly because he genuinely wants his efforts of breaking up to last when he is anxious af. And I fully believe by now that when he doesn't like someone, he doesn't care. He can be very apathetic. We haven't seen each other in a week, spoken quite a bit, but I know he doesn't miss me, and he doesn't like me. When he is bored due to something, he thinks that getting rid of that from his life will make his life the most exciting. He is a maximizer, so he is extremely careful to spend energy on what he thinks will give him a good return. He can be very selfish and self-centered, and everything can become about him, his needs, and how he can get that. He is not feeling the relationship, and his brain is craving novelty. When he is in this phase, all that matters to him is how to get that novelty.

His image is important to him, and it matters to him very deeply that he doesn't get blamed if this doesn't work out. So I think he wants me to keep being friendly after the breakup and leave him amicably rather than just block him. He keeps repeating that there is a little hope, we are fundamentally different, and things like that most of the time because he doesn't want to be responsible for making me stay and try on this if he needs to break up again in a week.

By saying this, he is probably making sure that I know this is not a committed relationship either. So if I decide to work with him, I have a full picture and that there is no accountability and responsibility on his end. ***And secondly, a lot of utmost honest words from him are because I dig deep and ask questions, a lot of questions around why he is feeling that way, etc.***, ***so that I can extract his raw, unfiltered thoughts.*** In the last three months, and six breakup trials, after every failed breakup trial, he told me not to give up until he goes to a therapist and does work, but then his anxiety takes over, and he keeps trying to break up again and again.",2022-06-11 04:16:23,Unknown,1411,v9jopv,1820,ADHD,"My boyfriend wants to break up because the relationship is too easy, too comfortable.

Treblenhparadise," Hi everyone. I'd like to bring awareness to a popular psychologist on TikTok who has recently come out and pinned a video on her account that basically discredits ADHD as a disorder. She is also known as the holistic psychologist.

My partner has ADHD, and she suffers so much from it. Honestly, you could say her trauma is because of how people reacted to her ADHD.

However, this ""psychologist"" claimed that ADHD is a coping mechanism for trauma in her most recent TikTok, which she even proudly pinned on her profile. She has made conflicting claims in the replies saying ADHD is something you can't be born with (and then cited a study from 2016...even though it's 2022 and numerous studies have come out since then) and then said also ADHD is not genetic, and that it's purely environmental (thus implying, ADHD is only because you experienced trauma, and it's a coping mechanism and not a legitimate disorder). Because of backlash, she's now saying ADHD is a result of your environment and genetics but that you still cannot be born with it.

She's the type of person to say meditation, yoga, and self love are the key to curing ADHD, basically. 

Her inflexible mentality is considerably dangerous for a field as diverse and as perplexing (and constantly changing) as mental health. Not only that, but her influence allows miseducation about ADHD to spread. Her biases against every disorder except PTSD/CPTSD are very prevalent, and with her following, it's very scary how quickly people feel justified in self diagnosing themselves with a disorder like ADHD because they have trauma and seem to have ADHD-like symptoms, thus perpetuating the stereotypical ""ADHD"" in movies, further spreading misinformation about how impactful ADHD is by itself.

Really what I mean is, instead of ADHD being validated as being hard because it is its own mental illness, it's put under the shadow of trauma instead of actually being shown as what it really is, a legitimate mental health condition. 

tl;dr 

The Holistic Psychologist Nicole LePera on TikTok has said conflicting information about ADHD (and she changes her narrative whenever she gets backlash about it) which spreads misinformation. She is saying ADHD isn't genetic based, that you are not born with ADHD, and that ADHD is most often ""a symptom of trauma."" Her massive following swallows what she says obediently, since they trust her as she has the name of ""Dr."" I just wanted people to be aware of how she is abusing her title as a psychologist by infecting the MH field with her biases towards conditions that are not (C)PTSD. Please be aware of her and make sure to tell others you may know who follow her what she's doing that is harmful!


edit: 

Hi everyone! I didn't expect this post to get so much traction, but it's very appreciated that you all took the time to read what I've said. I've been getting some comments mentioning my misinformation that I've said, which is that I implied studies from 2016 aren't as credible as newer studies. I sincerely apologize for this, and I thank those who took the time to point out my faults in this discussion. 

What I actually meant is that, studies from a while ago, before when the YouTube Channel How to ADHD began to grow popular I'd say (so maybe before 2018-2019? I'm not sure when she got popular exactly so please correct me if I'm wrong and don't take this without a grain of salt), had a lot of bias filled studies regarding ADHD. This was the time mental health and psychiatry as a field were still controversial things to talk about. This included the topic of ADHD, where predominantly, when ADHD was mentioned, it was met with thoughts of ""school aged boy that can't sit still and interrupts class all the time."" 

At least, that's how I think of it. It does not reflect my views on all research done prior to mental health being more accepted within society. I think researchers were brave to research about topics society shunned at the time! This is especially important, since their research served as building blocks to the current knowledge we have now. 

However, I meant to point out the fact that she couldn't cite a study any later than 2016 in order to prove her biases, and to my knowledge, she only cited one study. This is comparable to the many other studies done since then that have continuously disproven what she's cited.

Alongside this, it's hard to respect a study that's cited by a holistic psychologist, since that name already implies there's going to be bias in the study. I believe mental health should be viewed in a holistic AND a medicinal way, since as I mention later, there's no one size fits all. 

And medication shouldn't be the only solution to manage ADHD, especially since there are those like me, who are medication resistant, just like how the holistic management techniques shouldn't be the only solution either. They should be used in conjunction when appropriate for the person. For some, it is enough to do one or the other. What works for you doesn't work for others all the time, this is especially true with what stimulant someone is prescribed for example.

For me personally, I struggle with PMDD, and if I'm not eating properly, my symptoms get worse. If I don't take my medication, I'm going to fall into relapse. And for other people, simply managing their lifestyle helps, or just taking medication helps. 

One other thing I'd like to mention is that I'm really happy that yoga, meditation, and self love help a lot of people in the comments with their ADHD! I'm not saying it can't help at all, and I'm sorry if I came off that way. There is absolutely no one size fits all when it comes to MH treatment. 

However, for many, these things are not enough for ADHD management. These are simply tools in the toolbox, and they shouldn't be the entire toolbox. Other things like having support and validation for the things you struggle with because of ADHD, therapy to manage feelings of worthlessness and feelings that you're lazy when you're just simply disabled for something you cannot control, and psychiatry help as well. Things like getting enough sleep and proper nutrition also play a role in the severity of someone's ADHD symptoms. 

tl;dr 

I''m sorry if I furthered any misinformation by not making it clear originally that is is simply HER studies that she cited that should be taken with a grain of salt. It doesn't mean to disrespect it in its entirety, but that it's important to realize it may also have biases in it that further harm the ADHD community, due to it being something that she, a holistic psychologist that doesn't look at everything in an unbiased way, approves of and that it was made in a time period that MH, especially ADHD, was stigmatized/stereotyped as a whole. Thank you to those who pointed it out to me!

I also talked about how there's not one size fits all, but that mental health is something that shouldn't be constrained to just a medicinal or just a holistic viewpoint. Medication can't solve the body's nutritional deficiencies that may be causing symptoms of depression, for example, but nutrition, good sleep, and self love can't be the only answer for most people, especially when they're exhausted those routes. For some, medication or holistic treatment alone may be enough to manage their symptoms of ADHD or any other disorder out there, but for most, a combination of both matter as well, since they feed into each other and can make things easier for the whole body and mind. 

Thanks for reading :)!

twinkletoess2000,"F26: Yes, I can get help now. Yes, this is a good thing. But god fucking damn it, why didn't it get spotted sooner? I've nearly died multiple times as a result of my wrecklessess, suicidal tendencies, overdoses etc. Because I'm a woman and I'm on the inattentive side, no one picked it up in school. Instead, I only started noticing it at university and following that, losing 3 jobs in a row for being... well, shit. ADHD is still perceived as only showing in hyperactive, naughty boys. In the UK, ADHD in women is severely underdiagnosed and its costing lives. The government are literally doing nothing to help us, the very people who need it most. Instead, we become addicts, drop outs or criminals. 

I'm grateful for my diagnosis and for my partner who suggested I have ADHD. But she isn't a doctor. It was their job to spot it. Antidepressants have never worked on me. Nothing has ever helped the endless crying, depression, crippling self-esteem and hopelessness. I'm so angry and upset that if nobody had suggested I had it, I'd have carried on my life in misery when there's help available. And if I'd got treatment earlier, I'd probably be a different person today. Life is literally x100 harder for us and the big people don't give a fuck about that. You literally have to diagnose yourself and beg for help before anyone takes you seriously. 

(I just wanted to add that because I'm an NHS patient and the government don't give them enough money, I have to wait another 6 months to begin medication 😔. This combined with waiting for the assessment is 1.5 years. It isn't good enough and I'm honestly disgusted).

Edit: can people stop criticising me? I'm venting. I'm not ungrateful or playing the victim. Please, I'm just upset. I'm generally a positive person and I will be ok. I'm more upset for my younger self and the thousands of others who are unknowingly suffering from this condition.

Eye_On_The_Bagel,"I’m 37 and started medication 6 months ago, which changed my life. Of the many benefits, I stopped feeling shame and hating myself. All of the negative behaviors that I tried to white knuckle for years are gone and I finally realized that they weren’t my fault, it’s just neurochemistry. Deep dive into free will ensued and here I am, a proud determinist. Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting was more right than I thought. Nothing is anyone’s fault. Anyone else have this experience?

Edit (apologies for the length): I didn’t intend to start a whole free will debate - just wanted to see if others had the same connection when starting medication of some kind and seeing how wild it is to be able to manipulate this meat sack of ours.

But since we’re already here, I thought it would be useful to clear up a few misconceptions.

Losing faith in free will doesn’t mean that people don’t have choice, responsibility, and consequence - they do. It simply removes judgment for why people do what they do and increases compassion and love. Indulge me…

Choice
I make thousands of choices a day, all of which have consequences. But in reality those choices are predetermined by prior causes, and future events are determined by the choices that I make now. 

Let’s say I’m addicted to opioids. Now, is that due to my mother’s side of the family having genetics prone to risk-seeking behavior, or due to the choices that led to the moment that I broke my back and introduced me to pills, or what I ate for breakfast the day of the accident, or that thing my second grade teacher said that one time that led me to do that one thing, or that time my caveman ancestor was attacked by a warring tribe 200,000 years ago or which direction the cosmic microwave background moved through that one part of space during early universe expansion? Yes. Yes, plus trillions of other things. It’s turtles all the way down, and it is a matter of faith to believe otherwise. It’s hard to think about, but that doesn’t make it any less true.

This part isn’t really controversial, or even that interesting (in my opinion). Newtonian physics is inherently deterministic, so the only part that’s really debatable (and the reason that determinism isn’t yet definitive) is because we don’t have an answer to the question, “what is consciousness” and, more importantly, “can it impact the physical universe from outside of the physical universe?”. This gets into quantum stuff and spirituality and all kinds of things. Sure, maybe, but who knows.

What we do know, however, is that a blind person can’t ‘choose’ to see, a dog can’t ‘choose’ to do algebra, and I can’t ‘choose’ to focus on my taxes for six hours straight. It’s just not in the cards. It’s luck, good or bad. Now, I can choose to take a pill that changes my biology (in this case dopamine and norepinephrine regulation) that allows me to do my taxes, but that choice is based on my ability to make that choice, which is based on my ability to seek change, which is based on my ability to recognize personal deficiencies, and so on. Same for depression or obesity or any number of things the meat computer in my skull could output that aren’t very useful in 2023 human life. And these abilities are based on my biology (nature + nurture). It’s turtles all the way down. 

Compassion
For some reason, people think that having unconditional compassion for people means that they don’t suffer the consequences for their ‘bad’ choices. Off the hook - a free ride. 

Let’s take a long and complicated example: Bob intentionally murders Bill, an innocent stranger. The end.

Okay. What’s the range of judgements we make, knowing nothing else about this situation? Probably everything from “Bob is a monster and he deserves capital punishment” to “Bob is dangerous and he deserves prison for life” to “Bob is crazy and he deserves to be locked up in a mental facility for life” to “Bob is Bob and he deserves compassion and rehabilitation.” All of these actually result in the same outcome for us - the world is safe from Bob. But they are very different in terms of how we feel about Bob and how Bob feels about himself and others.

Of course right now we don’t really have a solution for the most challenging outliers of brain chemistry gone wrong, such as those with damaged amygdalas that go on a shooting spree or those with pleasure centers that light up to prepubescent children. But what I’m saying is that one day we will have a ‘serial-killer pill’ and a ‘pedophile pill’ that will allow these people to regulate their harmful desires to the point that they can live normal lives in society without risk of hurting others. And then we’ll look back at how we treat them today in the same way that we look back at witches being burned for being possessed by demons, which we now know was just schizophrenia or epilepsy, meaning that they just had dysregulated dopamine and glutamate or GABA and glutamate, respectively.

Compassion doesn’t absolve consequence. My brain is fucked up in all kinds of ways that drive me crazy on a daily basis. And I suffer the financial, emotional, and social consequences for that. Having compassion for myself and from others simply removes the blame and shame from the equation and increases the love and empathy. And the murderer still goes to jail, but realizing that it’s not really their fault in the traditional sense that we attribute blame changes the whole relationship we have with ourselves and each other. Instead of “rot in hell bitch” it’s “I’m sorry for how your brain works, but we need to keep others safe and I hope you’ll understand.” We finally stop judging ourselves and others so goddamn much and focus on working with what we have, all trying to live a good life as well as we can. 

It seems to me that removing judgment is bigger than we realize and one of the things that that Jesus dude got right.

Instead of someone struggling with obesity shame spiraling into worse eating habits, ruining their physical and mental health, what if they said, “Hey everyone! Check this out - I can’t control my eating! Isn’t that wild! There’s seemingly nothing I can do about it without biological intervention! What a world. I drew the good luck card in other ways, but my brain just isn’t built for living in a time and place where unhealthy food is abundant and convenient. Congrats to those lucky ones whose brains have a healthy glucose-like peptides (GLP-1) balance and don’t have that problem! I’m going to try and figure out if I can get mine in balance too. Wish me luck!”
 
To which the free will world replies with certainty, “Whatever makes you feel better about your poor choices fatty.”

Then bringing it back home, I could say (like I did for 30 years), “why the fuck can’t I focus or relax or turn my brain off or chill the fuck out?! What’s wrong with me?”

Instead, “Hey everyone! I have a little less dopamine and norepinephrine between the synapses of my brain, resulting in challenges regulating my emotions from anger and impulsivity to attention and focus to pleasure and reward! Fascinating right?! Brains are cool and annoying. Maybe this was useful when my ancestors were protecting themselves from invasion, but I wish I could just turn my brain chatter off and feel calm for once. Maybe there’s a way I can change how my brain works. Let’s try to solve the chemistry project.” 

To which the free will world says, “How about you just try harder? That works for me.” or “Just relax, man. It’s not hard.”

This self-compassionate approach is so easy to dismiss because not only do they sound like excuses for “poor choices”, but they are confirmed to be excuses because the ones saying them are the very ones making the bad choices! If a skinny person or someone without ADHD, respectively, made these arguments, maybe people would listen a little more due to their “credibility” as someone without bias. The sinister truth is of course that by definition they can’t understand.

You might be generally okay with this much, but now this will likely tip you into pissed-off territory:

If we shouldn't receive blame for our ‘bad’ choices, then that means that we shouldn't receive credit for our ‘good’ choices either. Which means that no one ‘deserves’ what they get, good or bad. I won’t dive into that, but you can logically see how it’s exactly the same.

Feel free to have your brain create an experience of choice to decide that ‘you’ disagree with this and signal for norepinephrine release and angry typing in the comments. After all, it’s already been decided, so I can’t stop it.

Much love to the thread and regardless of what you think about free will, I wish you a life of compassion and love for yourself and from others in your life. Because you deserve it. Not because you earned it, but because we’re all the same, an inevitable little blip of evolutionary mechanics. But we get to breathe today and our struggles, as fucking brutal as they can be, are at least partially treatable, and for that I’m grateful for my incredible good luck.",2023-12-07 20:57:53,Good,424,18cy14c,925,ADHD,Did starting ADHD medication destroy your belief in free will?,0.92

777sadurn777,"**EDIT:** Reading everyone's comments that I inspired them to not give up makes me so happy!! I did not expect this post to get so big and I'm extremely grateful for all of the amazing positive feedback! I just want to add that I am NOT advocating for relying 100% on medication and I do still have to put in the work to stay focused and not lose hours of my day. I still have many symptoms of ADHD that I can only control on my own! I am very safe with my medication and try to take an off-day twice a week. As for those still struggling, I'm here for you and hope you get the help you need soon! This was not to rub it in ANYONE'S face but to share my story!!!

For 23 years I was told by psych after psych that ADHD and social anxiety was not a good enough diagnosis in itself, and that I must have something else along with it. I live in a pretty conservative pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps area of the US and was told to exercise, focus, and maybe try meditation or yoga. I was always offered a prescription for Strattera and mood stabilizers with no other options - just take it or leave it. Even bringing up the possibility of trying a stimulant would cause an eyeroll from doctors.

At the time I found this sub, I was ready to give up. I remember crying my eyes out because of all the posts about seeing people doing so much better after trying medication, and wishing that a doctor would allow me to have that chance. The people here motivated me to keep trying and not give up on finding the right care team who would not only help me find medication, but also listen to me.

Every doctor in this area, and even my own family, SWORE that I could not have ADHD. For the dumbest reasons, too:

""You're too smart""

""You're too young to be on stimulants""

""...hyperactivity? You sleep all day!""

""The ADHD is caused by bipolar disorder. Adults don't have ADHD alone""

""I can't give you a stimulant because you could lose too much weight"" (I'm obese though? lol)

and many more...

I didn't give up though. I knew the mood stabilizers and SSRIs were not doing anything. And Strattera was essentially a sugar pill to me. I jumped from doctor to doctor. Each one of them agreeing that I had symptoms of ADHD but insisting that I was bipolar.

I started speaking up for myself. I started reading everything I could about mental health. I was firm in telling them that I did not believe I had bipolar disorder and it made no sense considering I don't have an issue with depression or mania. I started refusing the Strattera, with one doctor even telling me that it could take OVER A YEAR for Strattera to kick in when it still wasn't working after 8 months.

Finally, it happened. I went to a new doctor. She almost laughed at the fact that I kept being diagnosed as bipolar with no real signs of it. She was SHOOK at the fact that none of these doctors offered any other medication for ADHD and that my anxiety was ignored. She prescribed me Vyvanse that day and asked me to come back in two weeks.

My life changed that day. When I first went into her office I was failing school, unable to work, obese, unable to remember anything, all tasks being difficult to complete, picking my skin, constantly being tired, and maladaptive daydreaming for hours a day.

**What happened after medication:**

That Vyvanse, along with finding a care team that listens to me, **got me my first 4.0 ever this past** **semester**, despite COVID switching all my classes to online. It made me to **start eating healthy again**. It made me **enjoy decorating my home and keeping it clean**. It made me enjoy **working out**. It made me wake up **feeling refreshed in the morning**. It made me **realize I'm a fantastic** **programmer**. It got me **back into playing music and video games**. It got me a **cyber security internship**. It helped me **remember to reply to my friends and family, which has strengthened our connection.** Oh, and I **stopped picking my skin for the first time since I was 6 years old!!**

The other who doctors didn't listen to me or didn't ""believe"" in ADHD told me I would get addicted to meth, become underweight, and have terrible reactions to stimulants without taking mood stabilizers or anti-psychotics. They refused to look at my ADHD as a valid diagnosis alone.

**Basically, what I'm saying is to please not give up**. **If you are from a close-minded town, have a family who doesn't take you seriously, or your doctor refuses to try other forms of treatment, there is still a way for you to overcome these obstacles. Stay strong. Pay attention to how YOU feel. Be an advocate for yourself.**

I struggled with these things for years and while it hasn't fixed all my issues (social anxiety is still p bad) it has helped change me into the human I wanted to be. And I'm not even done yet.

Unstablefolds,"I (26f) just got diagnosed with ADHD and my partner (27m) asked me if at some point he could have some.

I was extremely upset by this because 

1) This issue has literally made my life a living hell at times because of my emotional dysregulation and poor executive function and he knows best how it’s affected me.

2) I have family history of alcohol abuse, dad’s side has drug abuse, my cousins have drug abuse issues…I was super hesitant to try the drug because I was SCARED and for him to know my family history and to know that I take this because I NEED it and not because I want to.

3) He used to drink a shit load of alcohol when we first started dating (all subjective but 2-3daily and would get upset if i asked did could not drink that day). He took this drug before in college and know how it affects him and he wants it for recreational purposes. I feared he’d be an alcohol addict like my father and the fact he’s asking for my prescription now has me asking questions. I want to be able to trust him but damn my anxiety is through the roof rn.

TLDR; my partner asked for Adderall recreationally and I said no. He was upset when i said that was concerning. Should I be concerned??

My partner just apologized and said that the one time he was offered was by someone who didn't take adhd as seriously as me and it didn't occur to him how much it has impacted me negatively and it was inconsiderate for asking.

messy--mind,"It always felt like I would be able to put myself back together, but all these years of therapy and medication haven’t helped. The only thing that has kept me holding on is my wife telling me she loved me and that things will be okay.

Two weeks ago she told me that things will not be okay.

I don’t blame her. I hate myself - so why would she keep loving me?

My therapist is trying to get me to accept that things are not my fault, but I just can’t see things that way. I have had all the ingredients to have a happy life - I was the only thing that stood in between myself and happiness. 

I’m in my early 30s, (physically) healthy, with a supportive family, a loving partner, no debt, addictions, traumas or anything to be sad about - but despite everything I have going for me I have spent the better part of the decade too depressed to even get out of bed consistently. 

I don’t work, my wife supports us. I try to at least cook and clean, but she ends up having to do the bulk of the household chores as well. I’m just a burden, and the associated guilt form a very helpful depression spiral.

I have been depressed since early childhood, but until I was in my early 20s I still managed to be high-functioning and was mostly in denial to myself about my struggles. 

I’m smart. During school, I was consistently top of the class with little effort. I studied physics at university did well enough to publish research as an undergraduate. I had research projects planned and offers from supervisors that would continue into my PhD. 

But despite my attempts top ignore it - the soulcrushing feeling inside me continued to build. Finally, during my last year of undergrad I had some sort of panic attack during one of my last exams - and I could no longer understand things I knew well enough that I was teaching it to friends previous night. 

It made me realise I needed professional help and that I couldn’t keep ignoring the pain inside.

I saw therapists, sought counselling, tried several antidepressants. I deferred a semester of classes- I thought that this would be temporary and that the brain fog would go away when I was less stressed. I took up a part time tutoring job at the university, and just tried to focus on enjoying myself for a while and reducing stress. 

During this time, I met the woman that would become my wife, and we just clicked in a way that made every friendship or relationship I had before that seem shallow by comparison. I found she was struggling with depression as well, and trying to bottle it up like I had been.

I encouraged and helped arrange for her to get help like I was receiving. It helped her, and she was able to get to a much better place. But I’ve never really gotten better.

I just had 2 units left to graduate, they could be anything. It took years. Several units either failed or not completed. It was ridiculous, but I couldn’t seem to do things properly anymore, and I felt increasingly broken. I had always struggled with procrastination, but I became less and less able to deal with it. I eventually got fired from my tutoring job because I stopped marking the students work in a timely manner. 

To finally finish those last 2 units, my wife all but did the assignments for me. I finally graduated, but I was not in a place to continue my intended path into academia. I wasn’t even in a place to do tutoring anymore.

The idea was that I would take some time without the stress of finishing my degree to focus on my mental health. I moved through several psychiatrists and psychologists over the years. Nothing has helped. 

Over a year ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD. It explains so many of my problems, and had been overlooked until now because I had been smart enough to excel at school despite my struggles. 

I had finally thought that we had found the problem and things would be better. But the new medication - stimulants that are life changing for so many people with ADHD - they don’t seem to do anything for me. I can take the max allowable dosage and not be able to tell if i’ve taken it at all. The doctors are puzzled, and I feel defeated.

Over the years, I have been trying to write fantasy books. It has been one of my only consistent passions, but I have barely written a word in over a year now. And this is for something I am interested in and want to do. I can’t see how I could possibly do a daily job like a normal person. I can’t even get myself to stick with any sort of hobby, even things I do for fun. 

I can put on a happy face and be the life of the party for an evening, but then I am exhausted for a week afterward. 

I can make myself be temporarily productive with effort, but it’s like I’m borrowing energy from the future that I pay back with being so miserable that I can’t get out of bed or shower or a week. It is not a sustainable way to live day to day. I often feel like I have to leave some energy in reserve to a could react to emergencies.

My mood varies with no apparent cause. Sometimes I spontaneously feel almost like a normal person - and doing household chores just feels natural and easy. I start writing again and enjoying it. I let myself believe that this time is different, that this time things will get better. But this feeling always slips through my fingers.

The communication between my wife and I has (or had) always been very strong. We love each other very much. She has been a saint, but this relationship has become increasingly unequal and it is not fair to her how dependant I have become on her.

About a month ago, I was pretty much at my best emotionally and we went on a holiday together. I did my best to enjoy things and to make the most of our trip and do things together. It was unfortunate that she was feeling more depressed than normal, but I was understanding, trying to keep things cheerful and active, but understanding when she didn’t have the energy. It’s what she would do for me.

I was there to hold her as she cried. But she wasn’t just randomly sad like I thought, like how things seem to happen for me. She was grieving for our relationship.

Two weeks ago, she finally admitted that mostly she is crying about me. That she hasn’t been telling me the full extent of resentful feelings she has built up for me over the years because she didn’t want to hurt me. That she feels she can’t focus on her own mental health because she has to be strong for us.

She doesn’t love me like she used to. She doesn’t feel the spark she used to.

I don’t blame her. I don’t like myself, but I had tried to accept that she must be able to see a side of me that I couldn’t see through the fog of my depression. How could she love the ghost of a man?

She is going to be house sitting for a friend for the next month. She moved out last week. I helped carry the suitcases (and our cat).

We are calling it a break. A time to self reflect. For her to decide what she wants. Like how on aeroplanes they tell you to put your own oxygen mask on before you help others. But given how she held back on telling me things for the sake of my feelings, part of me is left second guessing what things are like for her inside her head. I had always felt confident that I didn't need to second guess her until now. 

She arranged a session with us together with my therapists to tell me this. They recommend that I spend some time at a (voluntary) inpatient facility. To be honest, the idea is terrifying, but nothing has worked so far. I am currently on a waiting list, and will probably be admitted in the next few months.

It bothers my wife that I have little interest in meeting up with people without her there. She finds it a burden that she is pretty much my only emotional support. I’m friendly with her friends, but I don’t really have any friends of my own, and to be honest I don’t(/didn’t) really feel the need to close companionship outside of my wife. She has close friends and I encourage her to do things with them, both with and without me. And even though I can enjoy when we do things with friends and have interesting conversations, I am generally more content by myself (when she and I are not together). 

It’s like friends fill a different mental place in her mind than mine, but I don’t really connect with friends in that emotionally supportive way (not that I’m closed off, I am open to people about my struggles with depression and can talk about it, but I don’t find any catharsis in it). I don’t know how much of this difference is us being on different places on the introversion/extroversion scale, me being too depressed to care, or if there is something else wrong with me.

During our month apart we are going on 1 date a week, and only contacting each other if it's really necessary in the meantime. We had a date this weekend, and there were times it almost felt normal between us. In the end, we were cuddled up on the couch and she was falling asleep on my lap like always. I said I could go and let her sleep, unless she wanted me to stay. She cried and couldn’t give me an answer. I decided that if she didn’t actively want me to stay, it was best for me to go and give her space. We both cried as I left, and I spent the rest of the night just aimlessly wandering the streets alone. I hadn’t done that in over a decade. 

I’m trying to keep going. I cried almost all the tears I had left in me last week, and I’m currently in that robotic unfeeling state. The house is clean because I don’t do enough to cause messes. I shower and brush my teeth most days. I have no appetite but I am making myself eat (but I seem to have lost ~5kg despite trying to make myself eat the same as before...) I’m trying to keep exercising (I wish I got endorphins from it like some people describe), but Ive only managed to go to the gym once. I’ve been trying to write my book, but it wasn’t flowing, so I decided to write this post instead...

The sad thing is that my daily life isn’t too different to the way it was before - Except for the crushing loneliness that I haven’t felt in over a decade. (Hello old friend)

I’m trying to take things day by day. I’m trying to hold on to hope that things might be fixable between us- because at the moment, that is all that is getting me through the day. 

I know that I should want to fix myself for myself, but even though that very idea is self defeating - I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t trying to fix myself for her. 

My therapists is trying to get me to see that this isn’t my fault. But if it’s not my fault - what agency do I have to do differently?",2021-10-13 03:16:40,Unknown,313,q6whyw,1125,ADHD,I am broken. ADHD+Depression has destroyed my life and my marriage.,0.98
DepressedMfer,My parents obviously aren't happy. They say that I can't blame my mental health or ADHD. That I'm being dramatic and others have it worse. That there are people with ADHD that don't use meds and are fine. That I'm doing this to myself. I didn't attend the first class. Then the second. Then the third. The more classes I missed the more my anxiety increased the more reluctant I was to attend. Also I fucking hate the major I'm taking. Can't stand it. I don't know what to do. No one takes me seriously. The campus itself makes me feel so lonely. It makes me feel suicidal. But when I isolate myself and not do anything I kinda feel fine.

boundlessdays,"Hi all, I've tried to write this post a few times now... I'm having a hard time condensing my story (no surprise there) so I've decided I'm just gunna share and hope someone reads and is able to give me some guidance. 

I (20f) got diagnosed with ADHD about 7 months ago after doing intensive research for a year and a half on the disorder. I'm a big psychology nerd and I get really invested into specific topics once I take interest in it, and after being told by a friend that I seem like I could have ADHD, I went down a very long and deep rabbit hole about ADHD... specifically adhd in women and how it tends to get overlooked, especially if they're the inattentive type. during this time, I found out that all of my siblings (there are 3 others, much older than me) and both of my parents were diagnosed with adhd when they were children. I asked my mom why she never got me assessed and she said she didnt think I had it, and she still doesn't think I have it. 

that was a little over a year ago... fast forward to now, 7 months after getting a diagnosis and 2 months after finding highly effective treatment (Adderall XR). my mom still doesn't believe me. multiple times, she has accused me of drug seeking and over exaggerating my symptoms and my experience. for a little bit of context, this last year I dropped out of college, went broke, have lost multiple jobs and had to move back into my moms house because I was no longer financially stable enough to fund living on my own. all of these are things that have pushed me to seek a diagnosis/treatment, and with the help of my meds (as well as a wonderful therapist) I have started applying to jobs, I re enrolled into college for the fall semester, and I've been trying to get back on my feet. but nonetheless, these things take time, and after being in the deepest depressive episode of my life for over a year because of my worsening executive dysfunction, my chronic fatigue syndrome, and debilitating forgetfulness (classic adhd symptoms) I'd like to say I'm making noticeable progress. 

my mothers reaction is, for obvious reasons, saddening and invalidating. but more than anything, its confusing. she, as well as all of her children (my dad is also diagnosed but not in the picture) have a diagnosis. my sister was put on Ritalin as a kid because of bad grades in school, and it helped her tremendously. she was taken off of it after a semester because my mom is horrified of stimulants because they're addictive. same thing with both of my brothers, but they both have decided to go back on the medication in they're adult years. my mom was diagnosed with adhd in the early 70's, when the diagnosis was practically only given to white boys with behavioral problems -- which means her adhd was so noticeable back then, that they felt the need to diagnose a little girl with it. I've given my mom countless chances to educate herself. I've offered her the information that I have found helpful in my journey.

I want my entire family to be happy, obviously. but I know I cant control how my mom chooses to perceive the issue. I just want some support from my mom. she's always encouraged me to come to her with any mental health concerns I run into and after struggling with depression and anxiety for my entire life, I finally have an answer, and I get accused of lying. she's against all stimulants, and she nearly shit herself when she found out I was on Adderall. she looks at me differently now. I know she's just projecting, but it doesn't make it any less difficult to deal with, especially now that im under her roof again and I constantly feel like im doing something wrong. 

I recently just went to submit a disability form from my psychiatrist for school stating my diagnoses so that I can get accommodations once I go back to school. it needed to be faxed over to the college, so I needed her to send it over for me with one of the fax machines at her place of work, and she told me she refused to do it because im ""not disabled"" and I need to ""get over myself"". (I know I can still send in the disability form without her help, its just stressful nonetheless.)

d1rt3ater,"i was thinking after my recent diagnosis what's not a ""hey this weird thing i went through as a kid"" and was, in fact, indicitave of bipolar disorder.

for example:

- periods of anger and generally being destructive (e.g. elementary school upwards-- constant calls into principal's offices, almost getting expelled and arrested in high school)

- excessive talking

- when i was first in therapy (age 5-6 as a result of trichotillomania) i was told that i was ""anxious"" when i struggled to sleep. got several CDs of white noise or meditation to play on loop but it made me more frustrated than anything.  

-  getting called ""sensitive"" due to my moods

- early substance abuse (e.g. i would swallow a handful of benadryl pills in 8th grade and use progessivey harder substances that i struggle with to this day)

- the obligatory self harm 

- long depressions that tanked my academic standing, or ""high"" episodes (now realized to be mania) where i would be too distracted to complete schoolwork

OtherPie2214,"I was diagnosed Bipolar in 2018. Since then, there are periods in which I denied the illness all together. I think I never been stable enough or nothing huge happened during the the last few episodes that would justify a diagnosis. I was wrong. 

The last mania bender I had lasted 6 months. Everything in my life was destroyed. I had multiple psychotic breaks.  I was delusional,  and now that I'm depressed, I see everything. All the damaged caused to my life. 

I lost my job, then my wife, and child which I see now once a week. I lost my vehicle, I lost my mind, I lost all my credit as I maxed it out on crypto scams. I thought I was bending reality. Sort of like spiritual psychosis. 

I got into company that do substances. I did the substances with them. I ended up renting a room of my apartment to cover the rent to a couple that's physically violent and on drugs too. I stop using substances back in January, however I continue using weed which I stop around three days ago. The couple is moving out next month, so I won't be able to cover rent. 

I am now hospitalized since I had suicidal ideations and severe depression. No appetite,  no energy, anxiety. 

I've been eating thanks to a religious congregation that's supported me for months now. 

I live in Canada, and my immediate family recommends me to go to Mexico as there they could care for me. 

I would have to leave the apartment which I can't pay but I'm on a lease,  they would evict me anyways after I don't pay for 2 months. 

Most importantly,  I'd have to leave my son. My family tells me that I need to care for me before I can care for anyone. They also tell me I can continue fostering a relationship with him online and that he could visit us in Mexico in the future. My ex agrees. 

I'm been turned apart from multiple angles. I could also declare bankruptcy, work a cleaning job which is the most easier to get for me and remain in Canada struggling to make ends meet while dealing with my mental health by myself. The problem is, I'm too depressed for that. I don't even want to be in Canada. The only reason I was here was because I was married. Now that ended. This illness made sure to destroyed every other possibility to a good life here. I did all this things yes, but it wasn't me. It truly wasn't.  

I even got in trouble with the police by entering cars that weren't mine. In my psychosis, one night, I thought I could just open cars and clean them. I would literally just enter them, clean them and leave. I got caught and they charge me for it. Don't After ask me how I open them. To me it was just magic, like I had an intution that they would open and they did. I didn't force them or anythinh. After a few months in court, they just wanted a letter of apology and proof that I am taking care of my illness. Next month, I hope the charges gets withdrawn as I provided all the necessary documents and then I can go to Mexico. 

I guess I'm sharing cause I'd like to know your opinion, your survival stories, perhaps,  resources or like just moral support. 

I know all of this is just horrible. Leaving my son behind, bunch of debt, but at this point I feel I should listen to my family and follow their advise.

""I was kinda of sad today... I needed to take a break...I needed to do some self-care and get a manicure. So important for mental health!!!"" Girl, STFU. You have no idea what it means to actually take care of mental health.

But do you think these same people want to talk about being committed to the mental hospital, being manic, self-harm, dangerous behavior, medication, addiction, obsessions, debilitating depression? Would you even trust them to talk about ACTUAL mental health? Of course they don't really want to hear about that.

They just want to talk about normal emotions and feeling feelings. That's not mental health. That's just the ups and downs of regular moods for neurotypical people.

EDIT: Thanks for downvoting my every comment. Thought people here would understand, but now I feel even more misunderstood. 

I'm not saying average people shouldn't talk about self care and (what they consider) mental health. Of course people should care about good habits, feelings, etc. 

I'm just saying talking about all this while pretending real mental illness doesn't exist, not acknowledging it, being intolerant or ignorant of it is hypocritical and hurtful.

Cat_of_the_woods,"Taking pills to manage my bipolar depression is a bad thing because it harms me? In what way? You mean like...

...Holding down a job so I can keep a roof over my head? What about being able to get out of bed so I can eat food, go to therapy, and run a couple miles a day for my health? Or what about being able to focus on the time I have with the ones I love, instead of ruminating and focusing on that awful thing that happened or that thing my depression tells me happened, but it didn't actually. What about being able to go to sleep for the 7-8 hours that I need to function, instead of being up for several days and suffering even more because of it?

Have you ever been so depressed that you went several days without eating because you didn't have the motivation to do it, completely forgot to eat, or the food just tasted bad for no reason? At least on medication I can eat food and be depressed rather than be depressed and develop more health problems.

If being medicated is such a bad thing, what about the people out there who aren't medicated and need to be? I'm talking about the people in prison, the homeless, the ones who are no longer with us because they succumbed to alcoholism, drug use, and suicide, or the mentally ill people being abused by a partner or family member.

What I hate so much about the pill-shamer is that so many of them don't really want people to get better. They want people to agree with them and stroke their ego about this self-perceived revolutionary idea that ignoring a scientifically validated approach to treating mental illness backed by years of research and study, is not a good idea.

I see these people claim that all I need is ""a gym membership and running shoes"" when I've had those things all my adult life, and it wasn't enough. Yes, by all means go to the gym and run outdoors. I've trained Muay Thai and fought in the ring, plus I run marathons - yet that isn't enough. I know my body better than you do, so why do you care?

You don't care - you just want to stroke your ego by belittling other people because pill-shaming and buying into a stigma, makes you feel special.

If anything, my commitment to taking pills whether it be short term or long term, means that I WANT to seek help and get better, instead of living in denial that I need help. I am strong even when I am medicated and honestly, I would take the side-effects any day of the week before I ever go back to a mental health hospital, like I did before I was medicated.

I especially hate this argument that ""people have been depressed for thousands of years before medication."" Yeah and what did they do to those people? They burned them at the stake, tortured them, exiled them, and said they were evil people - much like what you are doing right now. Not to mention the fact that people back then rarely lived to age 40, so is that what you want for the mentally ill, a shortened lifespan that is plagued with stigma, torment, and isolation?

People will say I need to just smoke weed but why would I? I've tried many strains said to help with anxiety and depression. But all that stuff did was give me panic attacks, vertigo, and make me unable to function for hours on end - so why should I put myself through that just to be a way for you to tout something you really enjoy? So what if my lamictal and wellbutrin is man-made, so many things in this world are. Just because something is natural does not mean it is a good thing - poison mushrooms, snake venom, oil, salt water, all of those things are not good for me either.

I am happy for the people who manage well without medication. But every story is different and everybody has different needs. My body is not your body and you have no say in when or how I get better. Because one thing is for certain, you weren't there when I was at my lowest, and you never will be - because you are finding a way to kick me while I am at my best.

Exotic-Book-6988,"When I (39F) was diagnosed with bipolar about 5 years ago, I worked with my husband and mental health care team to develop this personal “Bipolar Oath of Self-Care” and I have been dedicated to following it since its inception. I slip up here and there on the sleep hygiene part, but for the most part, I feel like I’ve been able to advocate for myself by adhering to my oath. I wanted to share. Maybe it will provide some guidance or inspiration. 

1. I will see a psychiatrist regularly for the management of my disorder, and I will participate in my treatment by taking my medication as instructed. I understand my treatment may take time, so I will be patient as my body adjusts to medications. 

2. I understand that bipolar is a medical diagnosis that requires medical intervention including, but not limited to: the care of a psychiatrist and treatment with pharmaceutical drugs, the care of a primary care physician for bloodwork and annual physicals, and the care of a psychologist (PhD or PsyD) for cognitive therapy. 

3. I understand discontinuing my medication without the direction of my physician can be life-threatening. I agree to comply with my doctor’s treatment plan, and I agree to maintain regular appointments. 

4. I understand that bipolar patients who participate in therapy on a regular basis are far more successful at managing their symptoms than those who do not seek care. I agree to advocate for myself by seeking therapy on a regular basis with a therapist who is qualified and/or specialized in treating bipolar. 

5. I understand that lack of personal insight is a component of my disorder. This means I may make judgements about my medication that are not in my best interest. I agree to work with my care team, prioritize their advice, and follow my prescribed treatment plan. 

6. I understand that strict adherence to a bedtime and wake up time will help with the management of my symptoms. I agree to maintain healthy sleep habits. 

7. I understand that exercise will help with the management of my symptoms, and I agree to exercise a minimum of 30 minutes a day at least 5 times a week. 

8. I understand that bipolar depression sometimes requires the assistance of others, and I agree to reach out to friends and family to help me maintain healthy daily practices. 

9. I agree to create and adhere to a personalized bipolar crisis plan which includes a list of my medications, a history of my disorder, the contact information for my psychiatrist and psychologist, a hospital packing list, and my hospital preferences. I also agree to provide this information to a loved one for safe-keeping.

10. I agree to practice active stress management like exercise, yoga, or meditation instead of passive stress management like watching TV or scrolling through social media. 

11. I agree to limit my daily caffeine intake and stop consuming caffeine after 2pm. 

12. I agree to track my moods on a regular basis using either a mood app or a mood worksheet, and I agree to discuss these results with my care team. 

13. I understand bipolar disorder and drug and alcohol abuse are strongly correlated. I also understand that these substances interact with my medication and can trigger a mood episode. I agree to abstain or limit my consumption, and I agree to discuss all alcohol and drug use, regardless of scope, with my psychiatrist.

SquareWalk6730,"I always wonder about my relationship with my psychiatrist. 

I've been seeing him for a year now, basically every week at the same time. I have been that sick; it was hard to take my medicine due to frequent delusions. 

He’s worked closely with me and has taken on a therapy role since I refused to see a therapist. We've had many hour-long sessions, and I often feel guilty since my psychiatrist isn’t my therapist. He assures me that everything we discuss is important for my treatment. 

He is incredibly patient with me, reading the many manic messages I send. I feel guilty, but he reassures me it’s okay. I message him almost every week and see him weekly, and he always responds. I ask important medication questions too, but I’m in contact a lot. 

I've mentioned the attachment I feel, related to someone who has gained my trust after medical trauma and listens to me. He assures me it’s fine as long as we keep discussing it. 

I’ve experienced mixed episodes, mania, delusions, paranoia, and deep depression—back-to-back for a year, with many medications. I’ve even accused him of trying to trick me into trying to make me addicted to my benzo, yet he still comforts and reassures me when I’m not thinking logically. 

Either I'm super lucky, or there’s something dysfunctional about this. I sometimes feel abusive in how I treat him. 

Can psychiatrists become attached to their patients too? He's super professional. But I wonder sometimes. Or maybe he just knows I'm that sick.

Snoo55931,"I know a big part of my stability is removing triggers from my life, things that cause stress etc. So over time I’ve cut out people who abuse drugs (no judgement, I just can’t trust myself), people I used to go to bars/parties with (bad for my sleep schedule, overstimulating, I don’t drink like that anymore), people who were emotional vampires or thrived on conflict (that one was just a healthy thing to do overall). That was a large chunk of my social life. 

Then there’s people I lost to mental health attrition. People I met when I was super social, open and manic. People who cared but I lost in depressive episodes when I’d self isolate. People who couldn’t (and shouldn’t) put up with my erratic behavior when I was unmedicated and undiagnosed. 

And there’s just regular life stuff; people moving, friends drifting away as lives diverge over time, changing jobs etc. 

I realized that I’m down to my partner and our dogs. Which is mostly fine. Do I get lonely sometimes? Yes, of course. But I’m pretty introverted to begin with. I guess I just feel like I’ve made my life very small to gain stability. Which has been a good tradeoff for my quality of life, but it still makes me sad sometimes. 

I know loneliness and social isolation are a problem in general, but does it affect us more?",2024-11-17 01:25:38,Unknown,29,1gsvi4y,36,bipolar,What’s your social life like?,0.97
Imaginary-Laugh2005,"My (26m) wife of 2 years (26f) just initiated a separation (pending divorce) during our last couples therapy session 2 weeks ago. I was diagnosed bipolar type 3 (cyclothymia) about 3 months ago and I am still in the process of getting acclimated to medication and finally understanding my manic and depressive behavior which has had such a negative impact on my relationship for years. 

Things have been tough for a few years now but really bad in the last few months. We were seeing individual therapists and a couples therapist weekly to try to resolve our issues and I got my diagnosis as part of that process. I have always been very reactive and unpredictable as well as anxious and my wife has always valued stability and would prefer if things didn't change much. She also has an avoidant attachment style so any time my behavior became uncomfortable or too unpredictable for her she would shield her emotions from me so until very recently I never understood that my ups and downs were affecting her so negatively. I didn't notice that she had pulled so far away from the relationship until she had already made up her mind. 

She's always be very outwardly supportive and caring but has sacrificed so much of herself to help me through my mental health journey but 2 weeks ago during couples therapy she announced she had enough and couldn't stay together and didn't have it in her to continue. I'm alone now and most of my support system was her family who have also left me and with this increased stress my highs and lows of mania and depression are worse than ever. 

I can't help but feel as though I only have myself and my reactive behavior to blame. I never was physically abusive but there were a few occasions I yelled during an argument as well as some other immature moments like smashing plates or punching walls during manic episodes.. I'm finally beginning to have a much greater grasp on my emotions and control over the way I act and I can see now how difficult I was to be with but I also don't want this marriage to end. I know I can't control my wife or her feelings but what can I do to prove to her I am changing and improving and becoming more capable of addressing and managing my mental health so she knows it doesn't need to be her burden anymore? 

I moved out as quickly as I could to give her the space she needs but my worry is that no matter how hard I work on myself I won't be able to make up for the mistakes I made. How do I own my mistakes and find forgiveness for them? Am I clinging too tightly to this relationship because of my fear of being alone or fear of failing my marriage? And can I ever be this stable and calm person I want to become and truly overcome my own mind when it seems so insurmountable? I really want to work on myself and repair this relationship.

hr_leroy,"I'm feeling really hopeless today. I don't trust pharmacology anymore. I don't trust traditional medicine. I'm 40yo been living with the since 15 and I don't know if it's the 13 years I was untreated or current life circumstances but it all feels like it's falling apart. This year is the first year dissociation, panic attacks, and delirium are impacting my job and I'm at risk of losing my job rn. I'm on probation at work since apparently my performance tanked (keep in mind i'd been in a psych facility then in IOP for like 3 months of the review, and received no warnings, just a firing meeting). Saturday I messed up, which triggered something like a panic attack gone delirium where I dissociated at least 30 minutes (I thought I was aaway from the floor like 5-10 minutes, not the case, and when I came back it was clear I wasn't really lucid). So I had to have a meeting about that (I'm a server btw). Then I impulsively drove to a friends despite them saying they needed time (we'd been having problems, totally different story involving brief romantic history, who they chose to date, and also they struggle with addiction and depression too)...I was clearly losing it, crying, upset, confused, angry, all of it. Thankfully they wouldn't let me drive home like that.

Now I'm depressed again.

I want a med reset. I went from substance abuse and unmedicated to sober and medicated and have no idea what I'm like unmedicated AND sober (5 years now). I've been reading ""Brain Energy"" and am really thinking there's something to the idea of metabolic psychiatry. I don't want to talk to my psych nurse about Saturday because I don't want a med adjustment...every little thing = tweak with this or that.

I'm tired y'all. Shouldn't management be getting better, not worse? Shouldn't I not suddenly be experience severe dissociative episodes and delirium if I'm on so many meds? Isn't there a better way.

Just looking for comfort. Scared of losing my job (my savings already took a huge hit during psych inpatient and IOP). I'm just scared all the time.

Big_Acanthisitta_127,"Hello, first of all I am a female 25 year old. I am four months sober from any and all substances because I was an addict/alcoholic. I have been diagnosed with bipolar, borderline personality disorder, and ADHD in the past, as well as a learning disability (NVLD). Based on my own research I strongly believe I am autistic. I recently, this past September, moved to Atlanta from another state in order to attend an art school. Up until that point I had always lived with my family and this is my first time living alone. My parents, specifically my dad fund my entire life - my schooling, my apartment, my food/incidentals. I do not drive. I take medications daily - two antidepressants (one for OCD specifically), an ADHD medication, and a medication for alcohol cravings. I also have a prescription for an as needed anxiety medication and a sleeping medication. I am at a total loss of what to do with my life. I procrastinate entirely, I am submitting assignments late, I just cannot find the motivation to do anything. 

I haven’t showered or brushed my hair in weeks. My hair is completely matted. I have been wearing dirty clothes over and over. My apartment is dirty. I have a pet cat. I am hopelessly addicted to my phone. I waste so much time scrolling endlessly and I hate it. I constantly feel bored or empty. I have no friends in Atlanta. I strongly yearn for love, and fear that I will never find it. I have a dream of getting married and I am unsure if it will ever come true. I have horrible luck with dating and have a history of abuse within relationships, mainly sexual and emotional. I recently deleted all dating apps and am currently fixated on a crush who lives in another state, and doubts he would be able to see me. I feel like I am throwing away my opportunity to do something good with my life. I attend class but mainly what I do everyday is sleep, or spend time on my phone. Any advice would be appreciated.",2025-02-03 11:35:26,Atlanta,6,1igijjn,3,bipolar,Bipolar symptoms,1.0
Cranburrie,"Last treatment is on Tuesday.

Stayed medicated. Drove myself to all appointments. Made it through surgery, radiation, and hormone therapy. Medically induced menopause.

No manic episodes, depression at a minimum. Kept up with my full-time salary job, and started my own photography business on the side.

Patting myself on the back here. But to all of you out there : you're stronger than you think, and you're worth it. You can do it. You're doing it.

UPDATE: Wow, didn't expect this to blow up. Thank you to everyone for the encouraging words.

To be fair I leaned into a couple vices over the past months....namely Bloody Marys and naps (especially by the pool).  ;) I put on a couple extra pounds some of which I'm sure are from alcohol. Back to a drink or two a week and weaning off caffeine. I'm cleared to exercise now so back to the grind. I feel like most of us roll our eyes at the whole ""just get some exercise"" advice...but it really can help.
 
I have a lot of anxiety over not paying down my debt while this is going on, and feel guilty over some purchases I made. But another small victory was sticking to a promise to myself not purchase a new camera until I consistently practiced for two months. (I had a ten year old Kodak). I've also gone out twice a week on easy hikes to get outside and exercise, and also feel productive taking photos. I LOVE my new camera and I'm happy I waited. Making small goals, spending time with editing software on the days I feel too exhausted to get off the couch.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, I've been straight forward with every doctor regarding my bipolar disorder and medication. The oncologist said my upcoming journey with additional hormone therapy will most likely require a change in my bipolar meds as well. She said if for any reason I feel mood swings or suicidal ideation to call her immediately. And to remember my body AND mind are under stress. I'll meet with her every six weeks for a while, and we're working along with my psych. It's a scary prospect when I've been doing so well but I'm in good hands. The more I think about it the less I'm worried. Being straightforward was necessary.

Thanks again everyone. Bipolar isn't a death sentence and you are just as deserving of love and support as anyone else in this world. Bipolar is only a piece of who you are and what makes you, you.

royalepearson,"(Tw sh and suicidal thoughts) if you are an adult with bipolar please help, I don’t know what to do. 

I recently got diagnosed with bipolar disorder while I was in my last depressive episode. Over the past year, I was manic and I ruined my entire life and then immediately entered a really bad depressive episode that lasted 4 months. In this time, I became at terms with death and felt nothing but pure emptiness and misery. I had a plan laid out to kill myself in November, the only thing that kept me on this earth was the fact that my boyfriend at the time would come home to find me dead, and I couldn’t bare hurting someone else after all of the people I hurt over this last year. 

I couldn’t get out of bed or on the couch, I either wasn’t eating or was eating everything in sight, wasn’t sleeping for days then would sleep 12-14 hours the next few days and it kept repeating itself. I am only 17, this is all so new to me still. Before I was manic I always have felt things so intensely, always had really bad mood swings, always had the negative feedback loop of my thoughts and anxiety. I thought it was just depression but when I went manic and then went into a very very deep depression, which was by far the lowest I have been my entire life (I have had an abusive childhood, bad home life, self hatred, friends fucking me over, bullying, a 2 year toxic relationship, eating disorders that almost killed me, etc) but I was never ever that low in life. The guilt of hurting people, the regret I had, the loss of my first true love, my everything, was gone. I lost myself, quit my job of over a year, dropped out of college, and started to self harm really badly. 

I don’t want to do this again, but it is like I cannot control it. Everything reminds me of what I did to my first love, my boyfriendish (complicated atm) is moving 10 hours away and him being the only thing that kept me here makes it scarier. It doesn’t help that I have no friends at all, people will talk to me and act like they’re my best friend and I will help them, care for them, support them, love them, but it seems the moment I let that guard down they either pick someone else to hangout with or talk to or just slowly stop talking to me. I can’t help but think that I am either just unlikeable, boring, both? Or maybe I just don’t click with people. I never have clicked with people, and I probably never will either. Either way, I have no friends, and my mom doesn’t really ever listen to anything I tell her about, even when I’m having a meltdown she’s too busy on her phone and not paying attention to me. My sister still involves herself with my first love because they’re really close and she talks about him and it hurts, so I try to stay away. When I try to talk to her she will listen to what I say then ask to hit my vape the moment I stop talking. I feel like no one hears me, I am starting to feel how I felt before. 

Being alone was fine before but now, I genuinely just want friends and a support system, but I don’t have that and never have had that. I am just feeling really down, falling into those patterns from the last time. I’m even on meds now and it’s still really bad. I know they’re not supposed to fix it all but it doesn’t feel like they’re stabilizing anything. I just don’t know what to do. This time around I truly have nobody and I am scared I’ll get like that again.

BP_gal_from_europe,"Hi everyone,

I think I should say this is a throwaway account. I'm bipolar and currently in treatment. Therapy took me out of suicidal thoughts and helped me stabilize when I was adapting to the meds, so now I'm here. The goal of this post is to vent and ask for advice because the way things go idk I feel like I will be miserable forever, even if that makes no logical sense, and I know it makes no sense. I'm feeling really stuck and could use some advice.

I'm a software engineer in Portugal, earning just a bit over minimum wage. My job is draining, and I feel helpless. My wife is unemployed and studying, so quitting isn't an option. I love and I want to support her in her quest too.

Although I've been way worse, and it's been months since I had mania or suicidal thoughts.  I'm exhausted most days, which stops me from moving on, you know, learning things that could actually take me away from this situation. I know I should just sit down for 30 minutes a day to study something else like full-stack development, something all my friends suggested, and idk 30 more minutes to apply for jobs on linkedin, but I feel anxious and disgusted whenever I open my PC at home. I can't bring myself to study or code outside work for even five minutes without feeling paralyzed.

Honestly, I don't think I'm a good dev. The framework I work with is really niche, and I never had formal education in the field. I tried going to college for computer science before I had the diagnosis, and I quit after a depressive episode and plummeting in every subject. Then I went to biology, something I still enjoy, and then COVID came and I had to get a job so I quit that too.

Also, applying for jobs on LinkedIn is the most depressing thing ever. Everyone has impossible standards and posts toxic fake nonsense generated by GPT with the same ""higienyzed"" marketing voice. When I finally get to an interview, nobody has barely even read my CV, and they all ask questions like ""do you know absolutely everything?"" because they have very little idea of what we actually do as devs. Then, I get to a technical challenge that I feel absolutely crushed by because I haven't been studying over the past months to be able to do them.

I've considered other paths. I write okay despite this rant, but never had the courage to write a book, and the effort scares me. I've started and gave up on several blogs about different topics. I've been a cashier, a biology lab tech, and a clerk in a healthcare unit (which was okay), but I was miserable in all of them.

Most of the time, I feel like I don't fit anywhere, that the way other people live is just soulcrushing and slowly gets to me. I've been in this job for over one year now, longer than any other I've been, and I already want to quit. Sometimes I think I should go back to my family to rest and build myself up again, but that feels like failure, and it is an irrational illusion anyway. I left my parents for many reasons – we were never happy together, my country is violent and full of inequalities, and I'd rather not go back to that.

Has anyone been in a similar situation of just not fitting? Of feeling the need to better yourself, but now managing to? How did you find a way out? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

\--

TLDR: I feel stuck, lost and paralyzed by the need to learn something new to get out of where I am. I feel that I do not fit anywhere I look, and all my options feel overwhelming.

Just in a mood to give up. I was sober from weed for 6 years and completely sober for 3 years. 
I’ve smoked three times and drank one night. Never smoked cigarettes or any nicotine before but I’ve began to smoke and vape. 

I’m tired of my mental prison. I feel like I have no escape but to constantly escape. I cannot function in social situations even though I crave it.  I feel like I do well and in an instant my perception snaps and I feel like I’m constantly saying or doing something wrong. I can never say the right thing and off putting towards others. I’ve villainized myself and I’m comfortable with the mental sickness. 

I’ve tried looking for relationships online since I can’t seem to build anything real within my social perimeter but my mental block shuts down anything from being myself because I know it’s not right. I literally don’t know what to say anyone even behind a screen because my life is so depressing I have nothing good worth sharing or bringing interest to others. 

I hardly ever leave my home except for work. Even when I try to go out in hopes to find some sort of social action I get anxiety almost instantly and cant process thoughts well enough to be able to interact. Most of my conversations with others are “transactional”. I only speak when I need something and have a hard time carrying a conversation outside what I need. I’m sure I’m just selfish but even when I want to converse more my brain shuts it down in fear of saying the wrong thing or offending someone. 

I function best in one on one situations and trying to balance anything more than that is extremely difficult. I can’t even be in large groups without flooding intrusive thoughts. 

I’ve began to self harm within this year and it’s becoming more frequent. It’s to the point where I’m carving designs into my arm, hand and legs. I’ve etched words into myself. 

 I was medicated for a while before my insurance got canceled because I was making too much. I didn’t trust the doctor much anyways. I don’t trust most people if anyone. 

Suicide is a constant reoccurring thought on lows. I planned a trip to another state to go to the mountains and hopefully drink and get depressed enough to finally pull the trigger. Never brought myself to get the drinks to do it. Suicide isn’t an if but when. I know it’ll happen at some point. I’m just waiting for my breaking point. I’m almost certain it will happen.

seriouslydavka,"I’ve read that roughly half of those with a BPD diagnosis have active substance abuse disorders as well. So I’m curious what everyone’s story is in this regard. 

I’m 32f and I’m a polydrug abuser. The people I’m surrounded by have absolutely no idea and would have their minds blown to find out what kind of poisons I’m shoving down my throat all day, everyday. I always seem sober, I’m never fucked up, but I’m constantly adjusting my internal thermostat. I have always had very little control over my mood swings and I think I try to manage them with drugs but obviously, I know deep down I’m worsening all my issues, all my symptoms, my physical health, etc. 

I work as a journalist in a pretty niche industry, I’m well respected professionally, I’m considered smarter than average, funnier than average, more interesting than average, more attractive than average, and even more emotionally and socially intelligent than average but it’s all one huge fucking facade. I’ve literally been perfecting the art of masking since I was a little girl and it was still all subconscious. 

I’m a thin woman albeit I don’t look unhealthily thin, most people assume I must exercise and/or diet which couldn’t be further from reality, I’m just an addict. But for a small woman, I can endure drug doses like an elephant. Honestly, I fear getting into the details of what I take and at what doses/frequency because it will sound hyperbolic and unfortunately, it’s not. I’m down bad. Like totally fucked. I cycle through about 5 substances on a consistent basis and rather than cutting back, I seem to be ramping up without very much control whatsoever.  

I know it’s so worsening my BPD and I know I stand zero chance of overcoming my BPD symptoms in any kind of meaningful way until I step off this merry-go-round I’ve built myself. I’m also blowing a small fortune on maintaining my habit. 

Anyway, I guess I’m just looking to relate. I’d love to hear about anyone who has actually managed to get clean despite the BPD. I used to be a journalist in the medical field so I can’t count the number of studies I’ve read about psychiatry and I’m very familiar with the nuances of mental disorders and the immense risk you take when you self-medicate so I’m really not looking to be lectured here.

recoveryaware,"Borderline Personality Disorder isn’t being cute and ‘clingy’ and ‘adorably needy’. Being with (romantic or otherwise) someone with BPD isn’t akin to taking care of a pet. BPD isn’t an ‘aw it’s so endearing that they need me so badly’ type of thing. 

BPD is a mental illness that is a conglomeration of several different tendencies and it’s not easy to diagnose. You don’t just decide you have it, just like you don’t decide you’re depressed because you had a bad  day, or you don’t decide you’re bipolar because your mood changes quickly sometimes. Believe  me, you don’t want it.

BPD is turning nothing into everything, is knowing you’re being irrational and not being able to stop regardless, is suppressing breakdowns for fear of being abusive or of manipulating the person you’re talking to into having to take care of you when they really don’t want to.

It’s thinking someone doesn’t care about you anymore because they made a new friend. It’s automatically registering new people as a threat. It’s a fear of abandonment and rejection that’s damn near omnipresent. It’s being able to shift from ‘I love you so much!’ to ‘I don’t give a fuck, I hate you, I don’t even want to talk to you’ and back at the drop of a hat.

It’s finding identity in a drastic hair change, and then feeling unsafe and desperately trying to fix it before you have to go out. It’s seeing someone you adore and trying to emulate them because you have no idea who you are. It’s waking up and trying to be a new person every day. Go vegan, go goth, go hipster, go glamour, cut your hair, change your makeup, gain weight, lose weight, and never feel quite there. Ever.

It’s comprehending ‘love’ as ‘pity’ and wanting to rip yourself apart if their tone is all too casual when your friend or love interest is returning compliments or affection. It’s regretting saying anything about your mood and desperately trying to turn the conversation around while simultaneously NEEDING to get it out. It’s wanting to bleed yourself dry as opposed to cry in someone’s arms because, at least then, they don’t have to clean your wounds for you. They won’t hate you. They won’t be annoyed. 

It’s the constant battle, every time you get upset, of, “Is this worth being sad about? Is it worth talking about? What is more abusive, talking about this or hiding it? If I tell them I’ll bring them down and I’ll guilt trip them and they will resent me and it will all be my fault. If I don’t, I’m a disgusting liar, I’m manipulative, I’m untrustworthy.”

It’s wondering if you’re faking your symptoms. It’s disassociating and feeling like a ghost for days. It’s feeling like you aren’t real, and then wishing you weren’t. It’s fear, a lack of self, and about a million different thoughts running through your head at all times. It’s trying to live for the people you love as opposed to yourself. It’s feeling suicidal and then feeling bad for feeling suicidal because, whoops, you’re being manipulative.",2022-12-01 16:44:25,Unknown,111,z9l8io,648,BPD,This is the reality,0.99
Efficient_Report3637,"I know BPD is considered to be the most painful mental health disorder and the statistics show that suicide is more common for pwBPD. I’m not at all denying that BPD is a completely debilitating and painful condition. I feel like my world is crashing in every day and I can barely function!

I guess my frustration is that I keeping seeing people online use BPD as a “my struggle is more than someone with MDD, GAD, BiPD, OCD, etc”. That’s kind of just a symptom of the internet, but it’s such a silly generalization. 

People end their lives over MDD. People with MDD are on disability because they can’t keep a job. They can be in and out of inpatient care. They can have addictions and self harm. There is so much individual variation in how people experience their mental health that you can’t say “I knew I had BPD because I had such severe SH and I was admitted so many times as a child”. Some people with BPD have never been admitted. 

My sister has OCD and she was admitted for months of her childhood, had to switch between specialized behavioral schools 3 times, can’t drive, is on disability, and we are pursuing getting her in a facility where she can have professionals care for her around the clock. Some people with OCD are completely independent in adulthood. A lot of people with BPD, including myself, are way more independent than my sister. That’s not to say I am not at a greater risk for intentional suicide (she is unintentionally a danger to herself and others), but our experiences are so different that it’s not remotely feasible nor helpful to compare severity. 

There’s no competition if we are all struggling in our own minds. I wish I would stop seeing people say “just” depression or “just” anxiety. Those things have such a spectrum of severity. It feels like the diagnoses have become so common that people forget how severe they can present. It seems everyone had depression/anxiety and while I don’t know what’s going on in everyone’s private life, the majority of people who talk about mental illness don’t seem to be representative of how bad things can get. 

I have a family member who has anxiety about sharing a bathroom and can only relieve themself in jars. That is not romanticized the way being nervous about asking for no pickle is. 

TLDR: Yay for anxiety/depression having less stigma, but let’s not forget that all mental health conditions are some presentation of anxiety and/or depression and all mental health conditions exist with spectrums of symptom severity.

efbb,"Deleting social media apps (for me it was specifically instagram) has improved my mental health in ways I cannot describe. The depersonalisation, identity confusion, crippling comparison, fierce envy, intense rage, is so  exacerbated by social media that I would go as far to say that using it is a form of self harm for me. Not one good, wholesome, productive thing comes from it. If I want inspiration, creative writing, quotes, art, fashion etc, can go to Pinterest or Substack and find all this without the triggers. The friends in my life that mean something I can message on WhatsApp…
 
The thought of how many obsessive hours I spent on there, doom scrolling, stalking my ex, going down toxic rabbit holes of girls I’ll never look like, nastily comparing myself to them, feeling such rage over FOMO, judging and berating people I don’t even know, to the point of pushing my already suicidal brain into complete meltdown and turning the ideation into real plans.. FUCK ME. WHAT is the point?  I torture myself enough without this little handheld vehicle to hell that I keep in my pocket all day being a fingertip away at all times. There is absolutely no way I can regulate myself with that constant stimulation and triggers, I’m not sure anyone can, even “normal” people. 

I know this is a societal epidemic of social media addiction, but I wholeheartedly believe that pwBD should not go anywhere near it, especially in crisis or without support/treatment. It was hard to give up initially, don’t get me wrong, but I haven’t been on it since December, and although I am still massively struggling in other areas of my life, my sense of self and self esteem, judgements of myself and others, general connection to the world, is unrecognisable from when I was spending hours on it a day. 

I just wanted to share this in the hope it may push someone else to also come off it. It’s so damaging and toxic with this disorder and I don’t think I’ll ever use it again. ",2024-04-27 00:28:58,Unknown,67,1cdth87,340,BPD,Social media is the devil for BPD ,0.99

I dont think i have substance abuse problems with weed i just put it under substance abuse since i mentioned the statistics neither did the psychiatrist who diagnosed me thats why i got the referral. I can take breaks and i do. Im not stoned out of my mind 24/7  but when i do have bad days  it helps me move on quicker.

My biggest problem with this is the fact that i have to wait 4 months on top of the wait i already had. If i knew i had to stop smoking for 4 months before hand i wouldve stopped 4 months ago.


And also a lot of the comments are pretty judgmental. I never said i was perfect but this is how i cope given the fact that i had no other resources  until 2 months ago. I started therapy 2 months ago. And the point isnt if weed is bad for me or if im abusing it the point is that im getting denied treatment for the way i tried to help myself when i had none.",2022-05-17 01:57:57,Unknown,186,ur57v2,247,BPD,Got denied treatment for my confirmed borderline because their rule is that you cant be on any substances and i smoke weed daily for my mental health it makes me more mellow and just capable of existing.

FunSignificance9922,"Anyone else have several diagnoses? Or am i just fucked

Was recently doing a reevaluation with my therapist as shes due to complete one every 4 months or so and wow. At the end as shes reading off my diagnoses and literally says “damn girl you’re fucked up”.  (Side note - I’m 22f, shes 26f and we are very close and comfortable with each-other so we both laughed at that, i took no harm to it because its true.) Anyways i was diagnosed at age 11 with 

Major depressive disorder

General anxiety disorder

Social anxiety disorder

But over the years that has been upgraded to 

Bipolar depression II

Borderline Personality Disorder 

Obsessive compulsive disorder 

Post traumatic stress disorder 

Substance abuse disorder 

And on top of all that she has now referred me to a psychologist to be assessed for ADHD. 

Ive always known I was fucked up mentally but for it to be confirmed and on paper is actually kinda upsetting. My life is unmanageable and seems to only be getting worse as i get older. I feel like im  never gonna feel normal or even content with all the shit im dealing with.

Anyone else out there with MULTIPLE issues?? I feel like a nutcase lol

Woomie_uwu,"I stg I cannot catch a break. I was recently diagnosed with BPD. I thought the stigma was bad when it was ""just depression and anxiety."" I thought it was bad when I was misdiagnosed with bipolar. Hell, I thought it couldn't get worse than the stigma I have as a trans person. But this? This hatred is next level. 

I've had several friends ask me about my mental health since being diagnosed- they didn't give af about anything else I was diagnosed with, they picked out BPD explicitly, told me that's the one thing they couldn't handle being around, and proceeded to tell me the horror stories they had dating a person with it. They then, as well as several people I've met on dating apps, proceeded to ghost me or block me on everything. 

Everywhere I look for resources to help me deal with this it's just articles and books on ""how to divorce a person with BPD safely,"" ""why you should run from someone with BPD,"" and ""why people with BPD are bad people."" I can't even find a decent therapist bc no mental health professional wants to deal with a BPD patient. 

There's an entire subreddit just dedicated to spreading vitriol and hate about BPD people. I get that the symptoms are bad, I would even say worse than a lot of other mental health conditions, but when has it ever been okay to ask shit like ""are all people with BPD inherently bad people?"" Insert literally any other mental health diagnosis there and people come in droves to point out the clear prejudice. Say it about BPD and you'll get over 1,000 upvotes apparently. Idk when discriminating against an entire group of people became a valid coping mechanism to deal with your trauma from a single shitty relationship.

I didn't ask to be this way. I hate that I'm like this and everyday I struggle knowing my horrible mental health is negatively impacting my loved ones. I feel empathy, far more than most bigots, and I promise I hate myself far more than they ever could. If they think it's hard living around me just imagine how I feel living with myself. I hate this, I just want to exist and be happy and this is just yet another reason my very existence is thought of as controversial and negative. 

Aren't my failed relationships enough? Is it not enough that I have to fall asleep at night knowing the people I hurt, missing them and wishing I was different? Is it not enough that I'm only like this to begin with because of severe abuse as a child? Is it not enough that I suffer constant intrusive thoughts of worthlessness and depression? I feel like to these people I'm not even human, it'll only be enough for them when I'm dead. ",2024-11-23 13:17:02,Unknown,35,1gxugpi,117,BPD,Why do people hate us so much???,0.93
patexie,"[ edit: so this got a lot more attention than I imagined wow. Thank you for all the feedback and I’m positively surprised that so much of you agree! However the amount of comments is overwhelming, so I most likely won’t reply to all. Also, this isn’t against people who can’t afford seeing a professional! I understand how very expensive therapy is. I just have a problem with people who self diagnose say they confidently, 100% have this disorder when it could be an entirely condition ] 
(I don’t want to offend or attack anyone, I’m just very frustrated with this and I want to vent. I don’t want to fight or argue with anyone. I’m curious as well if I’m alone with this or if anyone else can relate)

I sometimes get so irrationally triggered and angry at self diagnosis, especially with young people, and it’s even worse when people ask for diagnosis on the internet. People can’t diagnose themselves, most are incorrect. Some people are correct with their assumptions, I’m not saying that’s completely unheard of. But if someone thinks they have it, they should go to a professional with their concern instead of claiming to actually have it. Only people who went to school to learn about this in great detail and who have experience in psychology/psychiatry are qualified to diagnose anyone. I don’t want to say that people who self diagnose are completely healthy, if you think you have a disorder because you’re very unwell, then you probably do. But one can’t say what their disorder correctly is by themselves, people often misdiagnose themselves

If you wouldn’t self diagnose yourself with schizophrenia because of how serious that it then you shouldn’t do it with BPD either. Borderline is a severe and very serious illness where some parts of the brain not develop properly or makes them malfunction which is caused by some sort of childhood trauma when the brain is developing the most. And the issue with teenagers diagnosing themselves is that BPD shouldn’t be diagnosed until someone is at least a legal adult, but ideally when someone is in their 20’s as the brain develops until then and most teens with borderline symptoms and characteristics grow out of it until that point

And I don’t think most people realize how awfully complex BPD is. It isn’t just the vague 9 symptoms Google lists for diagnosis criteria, it’s more than that. I think a lot of people who self diagnose confuse it with GAD or depression as those are symptoms of BPD, but not exclusive to it. Borderline is a very confusing mixture of symptoms and mannerisms that aren’t all exclusive to it. A lot of times even professionals misdiagnose it and if they sometimes have issues with it because it’s hard to diagnose, then people who just read up on it on Google and take online quizzes will have a lot more issues with figuring a diagnosis for it out. And the thing is, these characteristics are in everyone, but the difference between pw/oBPD and pwBPD is the severity of them

Around 80% of people with BPD have suicidal thoughts and tendencies, 10% actually commit suicide. This isn’t a game, it isn’t a trend, it shouldn’t be romanticized or taken lightly because it’s absolute hell that ruins people’s lives

I don’t support self diagnosing with any other mental illness, not just with BPD. People can have concerns and assumptions, but only a professional can give them an accurate diagnosis. Lately I think there has been a growing issue with this and I hope there was a way to normalize having mental illnesses (as opposed to being shunned, demonized and not being taken seriously for having one) without encouraging self diagnosis",2021-01-10 19:52:18,Unknown,229,kuf9ni,213,BPD,Vent about self diagnosing,0.83
TheOsatter,"I’m not trying to self diagnose or anything, I’m just curious. I’m 14, going on 15 on December third and I have like every single symptom. I like to think I’m relatively self-aware so I notice it a lot, and my first session with a psychiatrist is next Friday. When I talked to a psychologist (who referred me to said psychiatrist), I mentioned that I did my research and mentioned bpd to which she kinda condescendingly smirked and brushed it off? I tried to ignore that but she doesn’t think I have it, maybe because of my age or because I’m a boy? She guessed either depression or social anxiety, and I do NOT have social anxiety…I think? So like, is it even possible to get the diagnosis at my age or like..? It’s just really weird that I have like every single symptom… (I’m in Germany btw)

Own-Substance-9386,"hello everyone. my 26 year old niece has been diagnosed with bpd and we've been trying to get it under control for years. there's no psychiatrist and therapist in the country we haven't been to. she has a huge problem with most medications, whenever we find a therapy that works for her, the side effects force her to change it (hormones disbalance, bruising, stomach problems that are extreme etc) she has anxiety, depression, though the self harming us currently under control. but when she is splitting (not sure if it's the right term) she also gets suicidal. she doesn’t study, doesn’t work and her romantic relationships are always a mess. the main problem is that psychiatrists here (its a small country) don't have a lot of experience with bpd. it took us years to get a diagnosis which in the end was suggested by a therapist and then the psychiatrist diagnosed it under ""personality disorder"". they act like borderline doesn’t exist. the second (and biggest) problem is dbt not being available. there is no single therapist that practices dbt here and i know how much dbt can help. my main question is - is there an option to ""study"" or ""undergo"" a dbt course or something online? my niece speaks english, but she doesn’t work and is a child of a single mom so she is not capable to pay an insane amount of money for a course/treatment. so what's her best option to be able to learn dbt skills? thank you so much 💜",2025-03-24 14:05:15,Unknown,16,1jim0g1,9,BPD,what's the alternative whendbt therapy is not available?,0.81
CosmicDivine,"I don’t really have anyone to share this with, most of my family and friends don’t really understand or cannot appreciate where I have been through this journey. I genuinely don’t want to come off as bragging or something, but I want others to know there is light at the end of the tunnel <3

Literal blood, sweat, and tears have gone into living with BPD. I am now 25, with my first diagnosis at around age 13. In that time, I have destroyed my life countless times, been hospitalized 9 times (with the last being 2 years ago voluntarily; which was actually my saving grace), have destroyed many of my relationships, friendships, and lost many jobs and housing. 

No more suicidal thoughts, no more self harm, no more self sabotage, no more drug/alcohol abuse to avoid being sober and facing my issues, no more days or nights of endless crying and wanting to just die, no more thoughts or worry of abandonment, no more panic attacks, no more identity issues, no more medication, no more therapy, no more obsession over others, no more anything (almost)!

I do still struggle with random anxiety and small bouts of depression, but I can come out on the other side unscathed, with my life still intact. I have only missed 2 days of work in 6 months (one due to car issues, and another due to being sick) which is a huge accomplishment, as I used to just literally quit my job and not show up ever again because of such bad anxiety or depression. 

Every day I wake up and I am in love with my life! I have a working car, a job that I enjoy, an apartment (soon a home) a healthy, loving relationship, a few close friends (although i struggle to make more but do try), I go out and do fun things by myself which my anxiety used to never let me do, I have two loving kitties, I am forever a changed person. I do not consider myself 100% healed, as BPD is something I will always live with at some level.  

Of course, part of the reason for posting is to share what helped me throughout this journey because we all know it is not an easy one and everyones situation is different but I want to help anyone I possibly can by sharing my story! 

Books that helped me: 
-How To Do The Work by Dr. Nicole LePera
Amazing book, was recommended to me by a friend I made during my last hospitalization. The most helpful parts explain how and why we perceive certain situations as depressing or unpleasant, and how to actively engage in switching those perceptions. 
-The BPD Workbook
Self explanatory! Worked through the entire book and dedicated week-by-week chapters and actively tried to implement what I learned into my life. One week would focus on recognizing and labeling my emotions when experiencing them, another week would focus on radical acceptance, and so on. 

-Daylio Mood Tracker (App)
I used this tracker for around 1,000 days and was one long term goal I had set for myself. It was very interesting to see how my days in the beginning were all awful, worst of the worst multiple times a week! By the end, I had a “worst of the worst” day maybe once every few months. Almost all days became ‘amazing’ or ‘great’. 

TO ALL THE WOMEN OUT THERE!
Ladies, do you tend to have more intense symptoms around or during your pre-menstrual period of your cycle? Do you often crash out and have the worst time of your life then in a few days get your period and be like “ohhh so THATS why I was freaking out”? Do certain hormonal birth controls cause your BPD symptoms and behaviors to become worse? Did your first ever signs of BPD arise during or around puberty?
PLEASE HAVE YOUR THYROID CHECKED!! 
Turns out, a majority of my symptoms (along side years of trauma, anxiety, depression, awful habits and mental states) were being caused by my hormones. My hormones may not be all of the issue, but resolving the issues with my thyroid opened the floodgates and gave me a healthy, balanced body and mind to begin the dirty work! Please consider your body alongside your mental wellbeing during your journey and remember that the mind and body are interlaced. 

I have other books that I read years ago, and wil try to find the names if anyone would like more books. I could go on and on about what I have done to improve myself and overcome this bs illness but I would be going on for days! 

This subreddit has been a blessing to me from the beginning, and thank you to anyone on here who has helped me through tough times when I used to post years ago. 

I wish you all the best of luck in your journey, may the universe be as kind to you as it has been to me. Don’t ever ever ever give up!

Abject-Sentence-7420,"I was raised by two devoted parents and (later) had two sweet younger siblings. My father is easy-going and incredibly patient. He has never been anything but gentle and kind to me. My mother is extremely generous with her time and effort. She is funny and bright and possesses the ability to make you feel like the most special person in the world with her praise. She can be a bit overbearing and critical at times, but she always put in a ridiculous amount of effort to make my life as wonderful as physically possible, and was far more patient than a lot of mothers are. Our relationship has become strained over the years, but I know that she still loves me very deeply. We were wealthy and I never felt any sort of lack growing up. I was naturally intelligent and talented, and never struggled in school or to succeed at any of my passions. I received a lot of praise from authority figures and got along relatively well with my peers (until I got older). 

I don't know why I am such a deeply flawed person. I know that a lot of you would be thriving had you grown up in my shoes. I have no idea how I've ended up with the same struggles as people who have been through extreme abuse and trauma. I have no idea why I'm such a naturally weak person. I cannot remember a time when I haven't hated myself - it seems as though I was born insecure. I started throwing tantrums at 7 and, though I express it differently now, have been an angry person ever since. I am cruel and vindictive with an explosive temper. My mother claims that my anger has given her PTSD. She hasn't been diagnosed, but I do not doubt for a second that raising me has traumatized her. My parents relationship has deteriorated over the years. They were never that affectionate or loving, but only started resenting each other once my anger issues began. My youngest brother adored me as a child, and mimics a lot of my negative behaviours. I will never forgive myself for ruining what could've been a perfect family. The ridiculous thing is that none of my relatives have any mental health issues at all. How is it possible that I've ended up so awful? 

I am impulsive and require constant distractions to exist without feeling bored to the point of being suicidal. I am incapable of showing affection to anyone unless they want nothing to do with me. I am conventionally attractive but feel so ugly that I want to die (and make it everybody else's problem). I've always wanted to be good but am naturally horrible at being anything other than a liability. I am still mean and am still vindictive, and lose all my empathy whenever I feel betrayed. I have major abandonment issues and am always quick to reject others in fear of being rejected myself. I have absolutely no reason to behave the way that I do. I have absolutely no excuses. I have been in therapy since I was 12 and have been on medication since around that time as well. I am continually getting worse and feel absolutely helpless in stopping it.

Please tell me if you are able to relate or can provide any insight as to why I am the way I am. I feel like the worst person to ever exist and, while I certainly don't wish to have had a less idyllic childhood, hate that I can't point to anything that made me this way. I don't think I'll ever be able to live without being burdened with ridiculous amounts of guilt, and am not entirely sure how to co-exist with myself. I have been playing both sides of a constant war within myself for years, and am so tired of having to deal with the relentless critical voice in my head.",2025-03-23 14:59:15,Unknown,15,1jhvh38,16,BPD,I think I was born evil,0.84

Giorgiark,"Hello, I used to be a somehow active member of this sub. My last post was about me entering a treatment center. [Here the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/b3u7bn/monday_im_going_to_a_bpd_rehab_center_wish_me_luck/) I've stayed there for 14 months.  I now consider myself 99% rehabilitated. I thought my experience would be useful.

Long story short. I suffer from mental issues for my whole life. I am 29 and starting to have problems at 12. At 27 I attempted suicide. The list of the disorder I suffer from were. Severe anxiety, social phobia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder. After my suicide attempt at 27 I was officially diagnoses (through SCID 5 test, based on DSM) for Borderline Personality disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, Depressive Disorder, and Passive-Aggressive Disorder. I also had a history of abusing Xanax and stuff.

So my year in a treatment center had transformed my life, I have remission of most symptoms, I no longer feel that sense of emptiness that I used to. I no longer have depression.  I used to have all the common symptoms of BPD (i thought probably I used to be a quiet borderline  To put it simply. I still got angry a lot, and violently but I suppressed most of it. Instead of driving my rage outside, I drove it inward.)

Still, life isn't perfect. But the difference between the person I was before and the persona I am now is like night and day, I can't even tell how I changed.

I now feel like my life is fair. I always feel like I was giving too much to bear. Living with borderline, and other mental illness is a nightmare. Right now is like I'm finally awake and I'm kinda happy. I feel like I have control and power over my life. The suicide thinking pattern was a big one for me. I no longer have it. like never.

I still doing individual therapy. I went from 10-15 (antidepressant, anxiolytics, lithium, mood stabilizer, etc) meds at the day to just one that I intended to stop taking soon.

The thing that helps me the most were CBT therapy and uncovering my dysfunctional thinking pattern, and slowly modify them. Also, I followed a program called STEPPS that is made for BDP disorder that is really good to learn to cope with intense emotion and extreme behavior.

It would take a book to tell all the ah-ah moment and the step by step process I went through, that led to my rehabilitation but I Just wanna say It's definitely possible to live a good and satisfying life.

I wish you all the best.

    He got into heroine at 18 to deal with his family. Him and his ex were both addicts. She emotionally abused him. He has been on methadone for 10 years but completely free of heroine, maybe 5. He is to do it socially when he was no longer supposedly addicted.

He doesn't live. For 4 years, I've had to yell at him to clean, cook, and take care of our pets.  Nothing gets done on his own. Even if i yell, not everything gets done. He wants a daughter badly. I can't imagine how he thinks that's a good idea. Even after yelling every day, threatening to leave, attempting to leave, telling him he's making me depressed and considering suicide, he still doesn't change.

femgrit,"Long read, probably interesting enough to keep you reading tho! I have tried 20 medications. Most of them have made me markedly worse. I’m currently on Seroquel, Lamictal and propranolol. I have gotten more stable after halving my dose of Lamictal and more than halving my dose of Seroquel, but I am still extremely unwell. Psychiatrists don’t know what to do with me at all. I know you aren’t doctors. 

29F. Chronic abuse for 25 years - sexual abuse, emotional torture related to sensory issues, severely unsanitary living conditions, welfare poverty. At least 1 man is in prison though they didn’t get him on what he did to me. Medical history involving munchausen’s by proxy complications, PCOS, Interstitial cystitis, endometriosis, neurological deficits from benzos, hypothyroidism, anemia and then mentally PTSD, tentative BPD, anorexia (recovered with lapses), ADHD, sensory issues and history of months-long psychosis in benzo withdrawal, one-time mood issues in benzo withdrawal (severe highs and lows), major dissociative disorder, PMDD. 1 suicide attempt due to involuntary hold for psychosis in benzo withdrawal.

Therapies I’ve tried: CBT, DBT, IOP, individual therapies like IFS, psychoanalysis, talk therapy, etc. I have been inpatient twice, both times have set my entire life on a drastically worse trajectory mentally and medically. One experience being inpatient caused my only suicide attempt after being forced to take 3 different antipsychotics at once and I’m not open to it again. The other caused my chemical dependency on benzos which destroyed the next 5 years of my life due to neuro deficits. IOP was less than useless because anytime I told the truth about my history everyone was scandalized and trauma groups where people actually related were too triggering. I currently have a great therapist. 

Have tried IOP, trauma group, CBT, group CBT, acceptance and commitment therapy, IFS, everything but EMDR. I’ve never been stable enough for it and the lack of control in sessions is unbearable. 

Medications I’ve tried: 

Clonodine
Propranolol
Seroquel 
Zyprexa 
Haldol 
Ziprasidone 
Gabapentin
Klonopin 
Lamictal 
Wellbutrin
Zoloft
Prozac
Escitalopram 
Strattera
Adderall
Vyvanse 
Hydroxyzine 
Trazodone
Ativan 
Medical marijuana 

Other than propranolol, Seroquel and lamictal every medication on this list has either been useless, made me mentally markedly worse, or caused intolerable physical issues. Seroquel is also causing intolerable physical issues - out of control insulin problems with my PCOS. Switching from Seroquel to something else has always been a catastrophe but reducing the dose has gone well - but the change in dose massively destabilizes me chemically until I’m used to it. I normally feel the advice is to not decrease meds when unstable and mostly add. Both adding and decreasing have ruined my life temporarily but decreasing has never in my life been a bad outcome AFTER dealing with the fallout of the chemical change which can be severe. Adding meds has long term harmed me multiple times. 

My trauma is so severe that I used to spend nights in the ER, for hours uncontrollably vomiting and losing control of my bowels due to terror and flashbacks. Doctors were trying to diagnose me with MCAS, other crazy shit but in the end it was psychosomatic and solved mostly by moving halfway across the country away from my family. I now only have vomiting attack episodes from PTSD once or twice a month and they are brief and more mild. 

I have never been able to support myself and have lived with family and then when I had to leave my family to get well, with friends. But it’s not a forever solution. I am currently in a situation where I’ve tried to work full time the last few months and it’s making me increasingly unstable. So tired I’m crying, thinking of suicide all the time, vomiting from fear etc. I need to take a leave of absence and I am considering applying for SSI disability. I am going to use my leave to go to therapy more (I’m going 2-3 times a week), try trauma group again, take care of physical health. I need 10+ hours of sleep a night to feel normal and I can’t get it working full time and having therapy so I think that’s a big part of it. 

I could try other meds, I could try ketamine… I’m using CBD for appetite and stress and can’t use it too much because it makes derealization worse. I could also try to decrease meds slowly because in the past meds have made me mentally unwell and I didn’t realize till getting off. 

What has worked: 
Sleeping 10 hours a night 
Individual therapy 
Using my magna cum laude brain 
Using my formerly pre-Juilliard creative gifts 
Aggressively treating physical health conditions
Reading feminist literature about disability caused by male sexual abuse
Time off work and school
Leaning on my admittedly many close relationships
Cutting my family out 
Having PRN meds and not daily 

I suspect my most productive medication situation would be to get off everything but propranolol and then take Seroquel on a PRN basis for intermittent panic, agitation, flashback nausea and insomnia.. and/or some miracle medication I haven’t tried. I can’t medicate away the trauma or neurological damage though, so I don’t even know what I’m expecting a medication to do at this point. I’m only suicidal when my life are is an untenable situation. I honestly feel like I am not mentally ill beyond what is a reasonable reaction to what I’ve been through. I’ve been told the same by professionals repeatedly. 

It’s obviously not a straightforward case and I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to financially support myself. To be clear, I’m more stable than I’ve EVER been. No suicide attempts since 2022, eating decently mostly, living somewhere safe, graduated college this year. Even still I can’t support myself and I can’t make it stop. But I just feel so lost and I figured maybe you guys would at least believe me that psychiatry has failed me massively and maybe have some thoughts other than try that 21st medication 😭",2025-04-04 22:41:26,Seroquel,19,1jrh58q,4,ptsd,Is medication even worth it?

LonelyGirlJournal,"I feel like not a full human anymore. Almost brain dead but still conscious. I’m 17F. But I’m living like a grandma on her death bed. Im not in school or college (uk). I spend all day in bed. I want to get up but I can’t. My rooms a mess but I’m not going to clean it. All I do all day is vape and drink vodka and do drugs. I have days I need to do things. I’m an actor. I have rehearsals twice a week for different projects. But I turn up hungover. And I feel ashamed. But if I’m not drunk or high I cannot live. Like genuinely if I stop I have a breakdown because all of the repressed trauma I’ve been trying hard to forget all comes back. 

I’m so broken. My life could’ve been amazing. I was a happy child and then the world decided to all come crashing down on me when I was 8 and it hasn’t stopped since. Time after time I got bullied,raped
, Seen people dying from drugs or suicide and trying to save them, be physically abused and I suspect even drugged by teachers in a special needs school and I couldn’t report it because when I told anyone it’s my mentally ill traumatised word against theirs. And they would literally delete the camera footage so if mine or anyone’s parents asked to see the camera footage they’d say they couldn’t. 

And that’s not even all of the horrible things I went through. Those are just some. I don’t think it’s fair that I should be forced to live after all this. I can’t have therapy wait lists are years long. Camhs aren’t even getting back to be after a severe suicide attempt which is supposed to be their high priority. 

I’m just supposed to move on with my life. I can’t. I’m too damaged.  I want to be put out of my misery. I would kill myself but I can’t even do that right. And I don’t want anyone to have the trauma of finding my body but what choice do I have. My family have ptsd from finding me almost dead from suicide attempts. I feel like they’d be even more traumatised if they found me actually dead. 

And I get what PTSD does to you. Especially this specifically after successfully and unsuccessfully ‘saving’ my friends from suicide attempts done infront of me. I wish I could be dead in a less traumatic way. Obviously I’d never do it infront of people but someone’s gonna eventually find my body. If I was euthanised it would mean I wouldn’t have to traumatise them. And my future isn’t going to get better because there’s lots of bad things that are 100% going to happen and I’m sure lots I don’t know about yet. So I wouldn’t have to deal with that. 

Really I wish I could just restart my life all over again and avoid all of the bad things. It’s not really fair that I should be forced to live like this AND be on the same level as people who don’t have mental issues. At least not as severe as mine.",2025-02-05 21:31:43,Unknown,22,1iidcjd,36,ptsd,I wish I could be euthanised. Living like this is hell.,0.92
Objective-Deal8745,"I’m a USMC combat veteran (Iraq) I was diagnosed in 2007 with ptsd by the VA. I started receiving health and related benefits in 2014. In the years since I got out I tried to commit suicide 2x. The first was half hearted the second I would’ve succeeded if my friend hadn’t come to my house to check on me. I’ve had a constant 2-3x therapists in my life and have group therapy. I’m on 5x different prescriptions and have a medical marijuana card. I get nightmares 3-4x/ week and the bad ones, when they happen, stop my sleep permanently for that night. I can’t open my blinds at my house, I get triggered almost everyday, I do threat assessments when I’m driving on the road. I can’t be around crowds or people standing behind me, I overreact to just about anything minor and dramatically underreact to any big or major. (A big wreck in front of me, I’m calm as a peach and I run to help/ give first aid. Gas pump malfunctions, I’m punching it as hard as I can and screaming at it.) People wearing baggy clothing draw my complete attention from whatever it was that I’m doing. I have to sit either in a corner or at least with my back to a wall. I can’t trust anyone, I constantly use light discipline, I check the perimeter of my house after nightmares. I’m constantly looking for lies when talking to people. I test everyone quietly to see if they’re going to double cross me. I don’t want to leave this country, crossing an ocean terrifies me, as does public transit stuff. I’ll drive to Oregon for a trip instead of fly with a bunch of people I don’t trust. 

I have failed marriage, then I was engaged (failed), plus 2x women who I’ve lived with (2yrs &  later 4yrs 2016-20) I failed there too. Took a long break after the most recent one (broke up in August 2020) then I started wanting a woman in my life again. First one lasted a few months and she left me to go back to her physically abusive ex. Because she said: “Being with you is too easy, it’s supposed to be much harder than this,” Met another woman who was also in an abusive relationship (mental and emotional). She left for a better life. I was motivated, I devoted myself to giving her the life she deserves. It was hard work, but it was coming back to me too, it was worth it. She moved in and it was 6 weeks of bliss (between us anyway.) Until he started playing dirty with her kids and her family. He started to really weaponize her kids and her family against her. Really cruel stuff. His ransom? “Just come back to me and all of this stops.” We push on together and she tells me she’s not going anywhere and I should start to rely on her (I don’t rely on anyone besides me.) So I do, I really start to allow myself to trust her. She keeps telling me to trust her and lean heavily on her when it comes to my ptsd. So I do, for a couple weeks I felt better than I had in a decade. Then she comes home one day and says she’s going back to him because “I can’t have my kids suffer anymore, I’m terrified of what he’s going to do next.” So here I sit on my couch not wanting to eat, not sleeping, no motivation. She said to rely on her and to count on her. She said she’s not going anywhere, and to trust her (I trust almost no-one) I do. Then she leaves right. After. Telling. Me. She. Wasn’t. 

I’m sure my disability with my mental health has something to do with it. She chose him over me and my ptsd. He was cruel and I was kind, he attacked her and I supported her, he belittled her and I empowered her. In the end all I did was give her the courage to go back to him. 

I give up! I give in, there’s no end to the BS. I can’t get better, I’ve tried equine therapy, EMDR, prolonged exposure, art therapy, music therapy, fitness therapy, yoga therapy. I have 2x psychologists and a group therapy. What do I have to show for it? A failed life, a failed marriage, a failed engagement, and I’ve learned I’m not wanted on this planet. I’ve learned I’m better off hiding in a hole than to show my face. 

I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

Edit: I can’t reach out to family. They’ve told me repeatedly that ptsd is a made up illness. They’ve told me as long as I persist with this delusion I shouldn’t come home or visit for any reason. I haven’t seen my family in 10years. Everytime I call them, they ask me if I still believe I have PTSD. Everytime I say “yes” they then hang up. All of them. 

Update: Thank you all so much for the support! It means the world to me. There’s a lot of good information here that I fully intend to take advantage of.

RussianGoon,"I was put in the mental hospital multiple times in the last year for self harm and suicide. When I was discharged the second time, I got an outpatient psychiatrist who diagnosed me with PTSD. I kind of agree with that diagnosis but after some research, I feel that C-PTSD would be more accurate. Given that I'm 16, It's very hard to diagnosis a personality disorder because my personality isn't fully developed. I currently meet the criteria for the diagnosis, but I wouldn't claim to believe I have it until I'm older. 

I'm just curious what is most realistically my diagnosis. My daily functioning has gotten much better recently because of treatment. When I was younger, I found my dad's body after he ODed, my mom left because she was running from the police, and I was bullied very badly. Besides the bullying, things calmed down until i was around 10, then I moved in with another guardian and was emotionally, verbally, and physically abused for multiple years. There was a ton of family tension between different sides of my family, and family members would lie and exaggerate to try and get me on their side. Amidst the abuse, I started drinking and doing any substance I could (otc) when I was 11, and I had had suicidal ideation since I was 8. I started self harming at 11, and now I'm 5 months clean. I half heartedly attempted to OD when I was 12, but no one found out. I planned to kill myself when I was 14, but I didn't end up going through with it. This entire time, my guardian didn't provide me with the mental health resources I needed, gaslighted me, threatened me, mocked me, and belittled what I was experiencing. When I was 15, my self harm got so physically damaging my family had no choice but to send me to a hospital because I almost bled out in my sleep. 

Now, conflict terrifies me. I'm unable to deal with anyone yelling, screaming, or accusing me of anything. I disassociate when in those situations, and completely detach from reality. With milder triggers, I also disassociate. I have nightmares a lot, and deal with this feeling of emptyness often. A lot of the time I just don't see the point in anything. Everything feels bland. I'm incredibly scared of most people. Sometimes I feel like different people just because i can act so differently? Like sometimes people tell me about things I did and it doesn't even seem like something I would do. I'm just confused. My head feels foggy. All I do is smoke weed and sleep. I have no ambitions. I feel like an awful person with no potential. I feel like a fraud because people think too many good things of me. 

After being in the hospital, I've been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, PTSD, Unspecified Eating Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, Marijuana Use Disorder, ASD, and they want to test me for Bipolar. They've mentioned I have traits of BPD and ASPD, but that's it. I just feel crazy sometimes. After research, I believe I more so meet the criteria for C-PTSD, but then again I'm not a doctor.

Royal_Charge4223,"In my mid 30's. Been actively trying to get help since 23. Married 4 years now and my wife is talking of leaving she cant handle it. She's already left a few times on the condition I will change. I do my best to treat her the best I can but it's not good enough.

I am emotionally dulled I think. I have anxiety, depression, and flashbacks that interfere with my daily life such as work.

Age 2-18 abused daily by parental units and some siblings (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritually). In my late teens started abusing myself (cutting), and then drugs and alcohol heavily until 26. Have been in recovery for drugs and alcohol almost 2 years now, and have seen countless therapists over the past 10 years. Working on seeing a new one that can do emdr.

Everytime she threatens to leave (she does this by not coming home from work and staying at a friends house a couple days to a week to think things over) it sets my triggers off like you wouldn't believe, feelings of worthlessness, abandonment, and fear i will lose my best friend if i can't change fast enough. This triggers even more flashbacks and makes sleeping or work even harder. I just discovered 2 years ago I REALLY need stability in my life and these events really throw everything off balance.

I want to get better and have made some great progress the past couple years but it often seems like theres no end to it.

TL;DR tell me there's some hope, I need some happy success stories with ""becoming a real person"" despite having ptsd.",2024-11-03 11:13:11,Unknown,23,1gig6ue,7,ptsd,Is there any end to it?,0.9
thegoosenell,"I really need advice / support. Things are bleak.

Five years ago, a repressed memory of abuse came up while I was reading an article - it shook me so much that I went into a constant state of severe depersonalisation, with no internal dialogue or images in my mind, and a feeling of being completely cut off from the rest of the world. It was horrible. It was like I had deid. I tried many different techniques / tools but nothing got through, not even a little bit.

Last year, I reached my limit and decided I couldn't take it anymore - I knew I needed the dissociation to go or I would end things, as my life had become so empty and dark. I did more research and started Internal Family Systems therapy, as I stumbled across many success stories on Reddit.

The therapy went well... too well. After a few months, the dissociation lowered quite suddenly and strongly, and to my shock extreme repressed trauma came up, and I realised both of my parents had subjected me to truly evil things between 0-5 years old. Suddenly, my whole life was turned upside down. I was facing hours upon hours of painful body flashbacks, every single day - reliving their abuse from beginning to end in full detail. This went on for months, leaving me constantly exhausted and on edge, terrified of when the next flashback would hit me. I also started having symptoms of a spiritual awakening - energy moving up my spine, heightened intuition, noticing synchronicities and messages from higher realms, although I wonder now if this is psychosis.

In January, things got worse. The dissociation lowered further despite me desperately wanting it to stay strong. I had a panic attack while outside at night (the sky suddenly looked massive and terrifying) and have been completely agoraphobic since, unable to leave my flat or even look out the window for longer than a few minutes. Shortly after this, I had a flashback to extreme hunger (I was starved often as a child) and no matter how much I ate, the feeling would not leave me. It was truly horrible and I was close to ending it just to escape from the horrible seemingly-endless pain. Once it finally passed, I was left traumatised and found myself too scared to eat. For two whole weeks, I was desperately hungry, losing weight, watching myself get weaker and weaker, before finally I was able to push through the intense inner resistance and start drinking nutritional drinks from my doctor (which I'm still on now, a month later).

During these two weeks of hell, a friend came to stay with me and care for me. She was by my side 24/7. When she left to go back to work, I found I was now terrified of being by myself, it felt completely impossible for me, like I would die if I let that happen. So, since then, I have had to ask other friends to stay with me and constantly swap between each-other so that I always have a person in my living room with me. I'm so thankful for their help but I know it's not a permanent solution.

I'm still dissociated, but not as much as I need to be. I'm in this horrible half-state where I can remember painful things and feel painful things, but still fully feeling stuck in the present moment, feeling so separate from the world and other people, with no access to self energy (so I can't do parts work) or the knowledge of techniques that could help me. The only thing that fills my mind is constant intrusive thoughts and images - thoughts of how I'm going to hell, how I'm crazy and broken, how everything is over for me.

At this point, my parts are all extreme and directly opposed to each other - one part desperately wants me to work with a therapist again, but another one is completely against the idea as therapy led to me being in my current crisis. There is so much pressure inside my chest as I can feel both parts pulling and pushing against eachother constantly (and then multiply that pressure by 20 as there's all these other parts warring against eachother over different things). I feel utterly paralysed and unable to make any decisions because of the fear of the inevitable backlash.

I can't allow myself to go to a psych ward. Done it once years ago, never again. My issues are too complex and I truly feel like I would end up in there for the rest of my life with how traumatised I am. To me that is a fate worse than anything. I was trapped all throughout childhood, I can't endure being trapped again.

At the moment, I have started on 50mg of Sertraline, although I am not noticing any big changes yet. I keep hoping it will numb me or reduce the overwhelm. I also have access to benzos but I hold off on using them due to the potential for addiction. I am waiting to speak to my doctor, where I will be asking for antipsychotics as I need the noise in my head to stop. Outside of this, I sit in my living room all day and try to distract myself with conversations with my friends / video games, feeling every minute slowly drag by, until I go to bed and get a brief reprieve from the mental torture, before waking up in an emotional flashback. The other day, I woke up in such a bad anxiety attack that it felt like my chest was vibrating, and my whole body shook so much it was as though I was possessed.

Sometimes a suicidal part of me takes over and its desperation and power is so scary - all it wants is for me to end things, right in that moment. I somehow find the strength to hold myself against it and sit for hours until it passes. But it's the hardest thing in the world, the muscles in my back get so painful from tensing against this force inside me, and I'm scared that one day this part of me will win.

I don't want to die, guys. I truly don't. I've worked so hard and survived so much, I have friends I love and I know I have so much to live for. But I feel like I've fallen into something impossible here... it breaks my heart as all I was trying to do was heal, I did what I thought was the right thing by going to therapy, but it has led to this...

It's been almost 3 months straight of the worst kind of torture, and I feel beyond fucked. Please, can anyone give me hope? Has anyone experienced something similar and found a way out? Any suggestions for what I should do? I'm desperate.

Please, if you leave a comment, be so gentle and tender, please... I'm so fragile at this point.

Dry_Lengthiness_4289,"This will be a long one since I need to give some much needed context. 

My dad died a few years ago shortly before I turned 18 from terminal cancer. We were living with one of his friends for the last few months coz he couldn't pay bills. And they promised to let me stay there. But they kicked me out right after he died. 

Thankfully, one of my friends took me in and I was able to stay with them. But with no highschool diploma, and a few months till I turned 18, I sat in limbo for quite a while. As events progressed over the next year, I got a job and me and my girlfriend got our own place together. 

We've had some financial struggles, and I'm still trying to get disability from the state. So I'm limited to 20 hours per week. Me and my girlfriend make our bills, close, but we make them. Just a lot of added stress. 

Now before I explain the recent events that put me under stress, let me explain what I've got going on. 

I was put through severe abuse sexually and physically in my younger years. And now later in life, as I've gone to therapy as an adult, I've gotten diagnosed with many things. I have chronic PTSD, Bipolar, OCD, ADHD and moderate autism. I'm on mood stabilizers (100mg Lamictal) which helps out with my bipolar. But it flares up and doesn't help with my panic attacks. That said though, I'm a very calm and reserved person most of the time. As you can probably guess though, my disorders don't exactly interact well with one another.

Now, I'm American. But my dad's side of the family are very traditional Europeans from hard earned old money. Me and my father were always very poor though. I've always been held to a high esteem with them. To much greater standards than I'm able to fulfill. They wanted me to attend college and make a 6 figure salary like them. Given my current circumstances, it's not really realistic. And now I'm pushing 20 and I still need to get my GED. 

I'm working towards it. But my grandfather has been on my ass about it. I never really discussed the mental health side of things coz they're older, and from a different time. But recently, I had to explain the situation because I needed to explain to them why I'm not working full time anymore. 

They had trouble understanding that I was disabled, and the details of my disorder.

The other day, my girlfriend accompanied me to a dental surgery I had done. My grandfather took us coz I wasn't able to drive back and fourth drugged up. 

Now for context on what I'm about to say, before my father died, they promised my dad I'd get his share of their inheritance when they passed. 

My grandfather informed me that I won't be getting that money. Because I'm disabled. Which, I never planned on having that money for my future. But it really stung being told that I was basically too dumb to be trusted coz of my disability. I've always been touted as one of the brightest in the family. And now I guess they've relegated me to being some kind of idiot out of no where. 

I just feel like shit over it. It's not about the money, it's just about being looked down upon for something so far out of my control. I've always felt out of place sometimes around that side of the family. I can engage with their values and platitudes, as I share some similar ones. I've always been able to conversate and relate to them with input of substance, even amongst their more 'advanced' talks.

But now I guess I'm just a loser to them. I'm barely pushing 20, and they expect me to have my life completely on track already. And I've tried explaining that I'm doing my best to facilitate a life for me and my girlfriend. But that it would take me a little longer than most. Not even because of the disorder. But because of the set backs I've had due to life circumstances, along with some of the disorder related things. And I guess it's just not good enough.

I feel disheartened. I'm pushing forward, and keeping things on track as best as I can. 

Thing is, they're acting like I should be done grieving my father, which I'm not. It was jarring watching the one person in my life that always loved me unconditionally and did everything in his power to take care of me with away.

What makes me feel a little worse is my mother, and my grandfather both act like my PTSD is nothing because 'people who go to war and watch their friends get killed can readjust to society. And that's much worse than whatever has happened to you.' Granted, I haven't felt comfortable discussing those details with them

But to summarize those events without going into too much detail, I was sexually abused at 4. I was subject to a lot of physical abuse from my moms side of the family in my adolescent years. Nonstop verbal abuse as well. When I got into my teenage years, I was sexually curious. And it lead to me being raped by several adults. 

I also had several run ins with bad partners. That did everything in their power to ruin my life. Including harassing me with false police reports. I don't have a fear of the police. Being already traumatized it, it was very traumatic having my life possibly ruined over nothing. This even went so far as them falsely accusing me of SA allegations as petty revenge. Even though retrospectively, they were 100% an abuser. Emotionally and physically.

My dad dying put the icing on the cake though. And I've never been the same since. I know from therapy, that PTSD effects people differently. And my girlfriend is the most loving and supportive person I've ever met outside of some of my closer friends since childhood. And I am thankful to all of them for understanding and helping me through things. 

I just feel like such a disappointment. A smear on my families good name as business gurus among other things. I wish everyday I could be normal. And, though I know it's not my fault. I just want to be able to live up to their expectations for me. And I feel like shit that I can't. I just want to be able to work full time like everyone else. But with how severe things can get when it comes to my PTSD. I can't really sustain full time work right now as far as my mental health is concerned. Social security has also informed me to limit my work to begin with. So I can qualify. 

If anyone has any advice or words regarding it, I'm all ears.

AcadiaKey2404,"I've been having these kinds of episodes?? for a few years now. Their cause is me getting triggered by something (mostly things that I'm not even aware of) and they normally last for a few hours but can sometimes last for a few days aswell. In these episodes I get extremely depressed but in a 'crazy' and passive agressive way (I get extremely suicidal, I start to self harm a lot, I want to destroy everything around me, etc.), I want to push everyone away (for example try to convince my boyfriend into breaking up with me or try to convince my friends to drop me) just to mentally destroy myself further, I also start to 'hate' the people that are closest to me, and I always vent to my friends in a pretty extreme way. I also wouldn't say that it's 'splitting' because as far as I know you mostly think in black and white when splitting, but in my case I would describe it as 'grey'. I just don't know what I want in that moment, for example I want to die but at the same time I want to live, I want my boyfriend to break up with me but at the same time I want us to be together, I want to completely destroy myself but at the same time I want to be happy, I think that I'm a terrible and toxic person but at the same I think that I'm not. I always feel so weird and confused, and it's really really hard to describe my mental state during these kinds of episodes in a more exact way, since I often forget most of the things that happen during those episodes and I just don't have the words to describe it. Does anyone else experience the same thing? And if so does anyone know what that might be? Is it even caused by PTSD or is it bc of something else? Or am I actually just splitting? (I also have depressive episodes, ADD, anxiety and my therapists even thought that I might have bpd). If anyone knows, please tell me bc I honestly feel crazy",2025-04-04 18:16:18,Unknown,2,1jrb0cx,2,ptsd,Is this caused by ptsd? tw mentions of suicidal thoughts and sh,1.0
makanireejoh,"I want someone to be angry with me. I want everyone to be angry with me. 

I’m a 28F and left my hometown two years ago where he sexually abused me for 12 years. I was 13 years old when he began grooming me and he was 22 years old. He began sexually abusing me when I turned 14. There are thousands of instances of abuse he perpetrated that I’m working through in my own therapy. He forced me to do many things and promised to take me away. He claimed he did what he did because he could “see a future with me” at 13 years old. I confronted him numerous times, suicidal, raging, confused, but unable to leave as I grew older and realized how fucked up it all was. He molded me into a human I hated, and I was only that way in context with him. 

I was a PhD student at the time I left and got matched for a mandatory internship on the other side of the country. I was going to leave. However, right before I did, my abuser got me one more time. He recorded me secretly (in a state where it is unfortunately legal) begging for sex and he sent it to his coworkers. It left me suicidal for weeks, I lost upwards of 15-17lbs because I couldn’t eat, and I kept having nightmares of the abuse. None of the people in his workplace or friends know what he did (of course, and every time I DID tell someone he was my abuser, he made me feel like absolute shit). A big irony is that he’s a charge nurse of a trauma unit of a psychiatric hospital and well-loved. I work in the field of mental health and decided I could never work in that city again, not just because I hate it there but because the professional mental health community is small and it’s probably known who I am, what I said in that recording, but not my relation to him (he forced me to hide that and hid it himself).

Last year, with the loving support of my partner (the greatest corrective experience a person could ask for), I made the decision to tell my family. My cousins and I grew up close (which contributed to how my abuser got his hands on me) and my aunts and uncles claim to see me like a daughter. He made me treat them like shit during the abuse because he hated them himself (e.g., threatened me if I smiled in photos with them, threatened me if I spent time alone with them, threatened me if he caught I was happy in any way with them and he was not present). I am financially independent (so no one has control over me in any way), live on the other side of the country, and have had some positive experiences telling a few of my cousins so far and wanted it to be known so I could set boundaries if I ever returned home. As you could probably imagine, one of my aunts victim blamed me to my face. The others haven’t spoken to me or pretend they never heard me say what. The only thing they promised is that they would separate us if I ever visited home. 

I’ve been undergoing cognitive processing therapy to really work through the years of abuse. It’s been helping some, and I’ve even managed to block or unfriend family members who have historically hurt me. Some I’ve kept around on social media because I still want some semblance of family and am working through the grief of not ever really achieving that. In the process of my working through, I neglected to block one. That’s how I found out about the wedding and saw all of their bright happy faces smiling with the man who sexually abused me and took my childhood and adolescence away. 

I’m feeling angry, hurt, unheard, worthless, every form of rage. I just imagine stabbing his head over and over and over. I screamed and hyperventilated for a few minutes while my partner held me through the trauma response after I saw it. My throat is raw because my body and brain felt like I was screaming and fighting for my life just seeing a picture of them. The betrayal hurt more than I thought it would.

My extended family chose their public image over me. Knowing full well what he did. 

I wanted to comment that he’s my abuser. Post everywhere what he did. But there’s no evidence (he literally burned it). I’ve tried reporting him two years to the police and to the state’s Board of Nursing because he has access to children, but there’s no outlet that allows an investigation. There are no protections for me, and most of my family  back home will stand smiling with him and not to protect me. 

I guess I just want someone to be angry for and alongside me. I want my childhood and adolescence back. I want him to pay, but I know he likely never will. I want him to never have joy. His new wife will never know what he did because he has control of the narrative about me since I left. He has control again. And they give him support so freely. This happens to thousands if not millions of victims. I’m another number on that list. 

Please, be angry for me. Please. I need people to be angry for me because I’m so fucking tired. 


———UPDATE
Thank you all for being angry for me. I went to my therapist yesterday and talked about sharing my story on my instagram, as most of my friends with whom I interact with regularly are there. Most family have been blocked and unfriended. My intention for posting it on my page would be to say goodbye to those who chose my abuser and their public image over me. So, I did. Hundreds of people saw, dozens of people reached out and shared their anger for me. I have felt more loved in the last 24 hours than I have by the people with whom I share my last name in all of my 28 years (though three of my cousins are cool and didn’t attend in solidarity with me, so kudos to them).

The news of me going public with my abuse history and my extended relatives’ attendance made it to my parents. They called, and I clarified to my parents that I don’t hate them; I’m sad and angry with them because of how long the abuse went on. They did not attend the wedding (they clearly weren’t invited to begin with because they openly hate my abuser; a whole other shit show in and of itself, but I digress).

The news will (hopefully) make it to my extended family who attended and support my abuser. They will victim-blame me, try to avoid responsibility, try to justify themselves, try to villainize me, and more. There’s a difference between us: I can own that I wasn’t the perfect niece or cousin. I have owned it. But that is also not justification for their inaction. It doesn’t mean they are innocent for letting the abuse slide. They knew. Not only did they do nothing, they openly supported my abuser and tried their best to hide it. Let’s not be naive here: they cannot hide their role in creating the perfect storm for abuse to go on for 12 years.

To them, I say this: you are not family. You are a ghost of a family. Your values are skewed to benefit yourselves and look beautiful and perfect. Once this reaches you, I may be dead to you. But you were never worthy of seeing or being in my life to begin with.",2024-09-16 21:04:49,Unknown,17,1fi7o9o,95,ptsd,28F.

Ok-Guest-5948,"Since taking the Sertraline at 100mg I’ve noticed a significant difference with my mental health, for instance, my comfort level of being outside with company has improved. Though I continue to have thoughts about being vulnerable around members of the public and having my back  exposed, I am able to without having any anxiety or panic attacks. My hyper-vigilance has also decreased. I’m able to walk accompanied with less of a need to look around me. My suicidal thoughts have also been smothered.

However, the intrusive thoughts are louder than usual. They feel deafening. There thoughts are distressing & cause me to feel guilty, even though I don’t want them to be true. I have been in two minds since taking the Sertraline at 100mg, my gut is telling me to continue taking them as they’ll help & without them I’m increasingly more unpredictable with my suicidal thoughts & acts to self harm. In my mind I feel trapped, suffocated, the unfamiliarity of the silence is causing me to panic daily. I really dislike what the tablets are doing for me. 

I’ve discussed with my mum about how I should be viewing this as a good thing, but I continue to have a lot of guilt and anger aimed towards myself. I truly don’t feel like I deserve to feel this way, I feel like I deserve to feel the true extent of my pain. A large part of me is hoping that by coming off them my mind will derail putting me in a situation where I act on my feelings of wanting to die & there I am unable to think ‘reasonably’. 

As much as I hate being depressed & severely at rock bottom with emotional breakdowns daily with my mental health, I also can’t ignore this strong urge to feel the most amount of pain that I believe that I truly deserve. If that means that I end my life then that’s okay, because I know that’s what I deserve. I’m angry that my brain failed to process the pain. 

I know my way of thinking is considered unhealthy, but I need an escape from the medicine. I also know that when & if therapy comes around the medicine will suppress the emotions, thoughts and symptoms, which will likely result in me not receiving the necessary treatment.

Electrical-Place6161,"Before we got together (22M) and (23F), my boyfriend was diagnosed with PTSD after witnessing a very traumatic event years ago. He was only 18 when it happened. He is very intellectual and aware of his PTSD. His perspective is—*If I can't cure it, I'll learn how to live with it.* He was also diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Being in a relationship with him has made me curious as to whether there is also something else he may have but was not diagnosed with. I do not want to sound ignorant and want to be supportive therefore I just need to know if what he deals with is due to his PTSD. I am also somewhat aware of C-PTSD but do not have much on that. I only mention this because he witnessed a traumatic event at 18 years old, a very young age.

He has angry outbursts, unable to control his emotions, any little thing will set him off, he's super awkward in social environments, during his emotional outbursts, he'll become reckless and impulsive. Most of the time, he dissociates. Self-destructive behavior, like speeding. Also is incapable of being alone ( I believe this stems from his abandonment-attachment issues ). He also becomes extremely pessimistic and it's impossible to try and uplift him. He often carries this dark cloud on him and it is even starting to weigh me down. During these episodes, he is emotionally abusive. Constantly thinks I am lying, or have other motives. Constantly overthinks everyone and everything. Once he becomes level-headed, has these super overwhelming feelings of guilt and shame, says he is a burden despite my reassurances. When he's depressed, he feels the lowest of the low, almost to the point he has suicidal thoughts but without intent. He recognizes that he suffers from all of this and wishes he was just *normal*. Knowing he feels this way, kills me. When he's hurting, I'm hurting.

When he is not having an episode and life feels steady, he's overcome with happiness and energy. He is super loving. He also tends to get egotistical but that doesn't bother me that much but I do notice it.

This is a never ending cycle, I love him very deeply, and he loves very deeply however the overall tone of the relationship is depressing, like I am walking on egg shells around him constantly because I am afraid something will set him off and put him in a mood. **Does PTSD make someone like this**? **I just want to expand my knowledge because I feel as if there is something more going on here, possibly bipolar disorder. After extensive self-research, I know they can be very easily mixed. I also know that traumatic events can trigger bipolar disorder along with PTSD.**

We are currently on a break because the relationship has taken a mental toll on me. Do not let me shit on him because he is a great and an amazing person, and life has been *very* unfair to him, I have the most patience and love out of anyone I know however it is taking a toll. I want to be there for him...it is not his fault how much trauma he has endured I do not blame him. After my initiation of the break, he decided to book his first appointment to see a therapist since I told him I cannot be his therapist. He also has been off of nicotine for months so I know it's not withdrawals, and he plans on quitting marijuana very soon. He doesn't feel right about being dependent on substances, especially when marijuana makes his anxiety 10x worse. I know PTSD is up there with one of the hardest things to live with, I just want to show love and support without him leeching off of my happiness.

No_Mountain_2515,"So couple years back I was falsely accused of something really horrible it starts with the letter R and this had led to me getting profusely bullied along with my car getting vandalized. Paint remover was thrown all over it and someone had slashed my front tire. Though four years have passed I'm still getting harassed to this day initially it was to the point where I tried to kill myself at least a dozen times. Obviously I am still very traumatized by what happened but and all honesty I am doing unbelievably better than I was just a year ago. And I had also developed multiple very serious drug addictions the most serious ones being Fentanyl (dosage on this one is unknown due to me using dirty 30s or you most likely know them as the term Blues which on daily I would use anywhere from 7-9 I was told by the homeless lady I was getting them from that they were significantly strong) (24mg daily), and methamphetamine (2-3grams a day). I apologize I understand my drug addictions do not have anything to do with what I'm going to ask but I'm just trying to give a clear idea on how badly this rumor had completely destroyed life.

So this is actually my first time posting here and reason being very recently I was put into exposure therapy because my PTSD just had not been getting better it had been getting worse over the four years and it's to the point where I am actually prescribed benzodiazepines. Due to my past Behavior obviously my psychiatrist absolutely despised the idea but unfortunately it's Last Resort move. I get really severe panic attacks when I go into public out of fear of running into someone who is going to start stuff with me or the possibility of me getting jumped.

The thing that I really regret to this day is that I never called the police for harassment I was so mentally fucked up from what happened that I was starting to believe that maybe I was over on evil person which just recently I'm now realizing I was completely wrong and I'm a very good person who would never hurt anyone let alone do such a heinous act. I've actually struggled my whole life standing up for myself so I have been bullied quite a bit growing up and I just let it happen and take it due to me being too scared to stand up for myself.

I'm so sorry I'll get to the point in just a minute I'm just getting some context. So one of the things that I'm actually very grateful for that happened to my life but yet did a major amount of damage to it at the same time would be methamphetamine. After my 2-year use of using meth I had gained the ability to start somewhat standing up for myself whenever I was high I obviously felt like the shit so I scared to stand up for myself at all and lo and behold I ended up earning respect from a lot of people. ( these people were unaware I was using I have actually only told three people about my meth use.) And finally after a lifetime of being stomped all over and picked on me experiencing what it's like to be respected and have proper boundaries set was almost more euphoric than the actual meth itself.

So basically after I quit using I realized people didn't treat me how I thought they'd treat me for standing up for myself and then I was able to just kind of start setting boundaries and haven't had any problems with it. All right so now I'm going to get to the point of my post basically I reached out to someone who had believed the life destroying rumor and I finally fucking spoke up for myself!!!!! ( I'm so sorry if cursing isn't allowed I'm just very proud of myself.) And obviously this is a gigantic step forward towards my recovery for the first time in 4 years I actually spoke up for myself and I had basically sad that I never ever did what I was blamed of doing let alone I didn't even come close to doing it and I also mentioned that I had never in my entire life even been the kind of person who would do something like that. I also talked about just the new people in my life and how they will stand by my side. Anyways I ended the conversation with I said what I needed to say completely up to you whether you want to believe or not obviously I can't make you because you're obligated to think what you want but I said what I wanted to say and I'm happy with it.

So yeah it's really awesome that I was able to do this and I'm proud of myself but I'm going to be honest now that it's been a couple hours I'm starting to get really terrified. I'm scared that people are going to start messaging me and harassing me online or at my house. I just want to be proud of myself I'm really sad because what I had finally gained the courage to do after years of depression and severe anxiety it's starting to just turn into pure regret and the feeling of stupidity. Can someone please please help me I would appreciate it more than anything if someone could give me some coping strategies or just advice? Anything at all because I can't sleep and it's 3:00 a.m. almost 4:00 a.m. I also ran out of lorazepam so I could really really use some support thank you♥️

evergreenyay,"I've always thought about making a post like this since so many people come on here scared, newly diagnosed and just overall understandably confused. **I don't consider myself as fully recovered, I've had a lot of ups and downs and a relapse just recently. I just feel like I gathered a ton of information and tools during these years that maybe could be helpful to share.**

**The basics of OCD**

Learning about intrusive thoughts, the OCD cycle and compulsions is the first big step. To give you a brief rundown of these 3 key concepts:

* **Intrusive thoughts.** They are thoughts (but they can also be images!) that pop up in a very unexpected way in your mind, they often cause anxiety and the content of these thoughts **scares** you or unsettles you. They are not wanted, and the content, especially with some subtypes, is egodystonic to the person that has the thought: that means that they probably think the opposite of that thought. The subject of our intrusive thoughts is something/someone we often value a lot, even if the intrusive thoughts make it seem like the opposite. There's a million example of intrusive thoughts, because we could have them about anything! They sometimes start as ""what ifs"", but they can also sound like commands, or start with ""I wants"".  A few examples (big trigger warning for , well, everything) : ""What if I hate my family and want to kill them?"", ""What if the door is unlocked and my daughter is going to get kidnapped"", ""What if I'm actually trans and have been lying to myself?"", ""Do I want to cheat on my girlfriend with a guy?"", ""I contracted AIDS but didn't realize it until now!"", ""There's definitely poison in this drink"", ""I want to break up with my boyfriend but don't have the guts to"", ""I'm a terrible person because I did X in the past, I'm disgusting"", ""What if I commited a crime that I don't remember?"". As you see, the content of these thoughts is unsettling, very polarized and often aggressive towards yourself.
* **Compulsions.** When we have these intrusive thoughts, we really feel a need to calm down because they hit you in an unexplainable, horrible way. The first automatic response is to **ruminate** as a way to make sure that the thought is wrong, and that's the main compulsion that we all. Let's take the first of the examples. You'd probably start thinking ""What? NO! I love my family, I went on vacation with them a week ago, we had so much fun, they're the most important people in my life"" and on and on. The problem is that by doing this you're actually feeding the OCD, that would probably respond to you with other intrusive thoughts, like ""Well, you fight often with your mom. Who says you won't lose control one day and do it?"". That is going to scare you even further and ruminate even further. Some people just ruminate as a compulsion, but many others have other compulsion that give you, for an extremely brief period of time, some relief from the anxiety. There are a million compulsions and they're often specific to the subtype : people with ROCD check their feelings with their SO or ""test"" their attraction, people with checking OCD go back and check the locks , people with contamination OCD wash their hands / bedding / furniture, people with false memory OCD check for evidence. There's also people who count, touch specific surfaces, pray, do a specific action with their body, say a specific things... there's a world of compulsions. As you can see, there are physical compulsions and ""purely mental"" compulsions. And even if you don't do any of these things, you still do the main compulsions that is common to all of us: rumination. What you need to know is that while compulsions make you feel okay for 5 minutes, you'll go back to feeling anxious again if not worse. The more you do those compulsions, the more you get stuck in the cycle and feel extremely scared if you don't do them.
* **The OCD cycle.** You get the intrusive thought --> you feel scared /unsettled by it --> you feel like you need to ruminate or do any other compulsion to feel okay --> you give in to the compulsion --> brief relief --> you feel even more scared and unsettled.
* **How do I get unstuck?** By refraining from doing any compulsion, by sitting with the anxiety of the thought but not do anything about it. Ride the wave of the anxiety and of the uncertainty. Respond with ""I don't know, we'll see"", ""It could be, who knows"", ""Maybe!"" and then don't ruminate any further. This is what you practice in ERP and CBT therapy.

**The basics of starting recovery and what is helpful**

* **CBT therapy and ERP**. When I started showing symptoms I was in talk therapy, and it made my OCD 10000 times worse. This therapist had almost no knowledge on what was effective for OCD and instead tried to connect everything to my past, which was useful in some way but didn't do anything to help me practically with compulsions, intrusive thoughts etc. If you have even the slightest doubt about having OCD or not, always see an OCD therapist or at least a CBT based one.
* **Self administered ERP**. I had some moments in these years where I wasn't seeing a therapist for multiple reasons, so I relied on ERP by myself with the NOCD app and it really did help a lot. Of course, it's always going to be more effective with a therapist but it definitely helped keep me afloat.
* **Keeping your health in check.** I think it's extremely important to realize what stressors in your life trigger an OCD episode the most. For example, I know that for a lot of people having their eating schedule messed up really triggers them. For me, it's sleep. If I sleep even an hour less than 8 hours I will be a mess all day long. Fighting OCD is hard as fuck. Don't make it harder for yourself by not sleeping well, not getting exercise, and in general neglecting your health.
* **Trying your hardest not to seek reassurance.** You've probably heard this word being thrown around a lot here. It sounds just logical to seek reassurance when you have doubts, the thing is that reassurance for people with OCD is like heroin. It gives you that very short but strong ""hit"", and then you need more and more to be okay. The problem is that, just like a drug, OCD can never get enough of reassurance. The more you ask for it, the more you feel like you need to ask more because OCD needs you to be 1000% sure about your worry, and that's an impossible goal to reach. This WILL have an impact on your relationships and friendships. A lot of people, in an attempt to avoid seeking reassurance from their loved ones, they come on here to ask for it but it's just as harmful!

**Some more things that have personally helped**

* **Working on my trauma**. OCD can be a trauma response in relation to some core belief you have about yourself. In my case, my core beliefs are that I am not trustworthy and I am in general , a very flawed and idiotic person, so my instincts and choices are always going to be wrong. OCD ""helps"" me feel a fake sense of certainty around things that worry me. When I hand over my life choices to OCD I feel safer because I don't have to take that risk of making my own personal decisions, because I see them as inherently stupid.
* **Exercise.** I know that when you're at your lowest with OCD the last thing you want to do is to move and sweat and feel more tired than you already feel. But it works, trust me. You really need to try it and stick to it a few times to really feel it. It gets you out of your head, it makes you feel lighter, it clears your head even if just for a moment, and it helps with serotonin levels.
* **Adopting some life philosophy principles.** Even if I've been diagnosed only for 4 years, I've had OCD for almost all of my life. And that shapes your views on life. My therapist helped me realized that I think that there is always an objective truth, that letting go of control means things always going south, that there's just black and white , and that if you aren't certain about something and still live your life regardless you're a bad person. I had to unlearn all of these things plus more, for example the fact that I have such a hard time trusting my decisions. I think trying to reshape the way you view life and unlearning all of these ideals that stem from OCD can have a very important impact on your recovery. You can be extremely good at dealing with intrusive thoughts, but if at your core you still believe that there can be 1000% certainty about everything that will really halt you. This will also really help when you face relapses, because it will give you that security of having solid principles that show why OCD is always wrong.
* **Having a solid support network.** This doesn't mean that you need to explain or tell about your diagnosis to everyone, especially when we know how many people know nothing about OCD and is also so very stigmatized. But having a social outlet can be extremely helpful, because OCD thrives in isolation. Just being in the presence of a loved one, doing outdoor activities together can really have a positive impact.
* **Connecting with people here in these subs.** A lot of people just use these subs to seek reassurance, but it can be a great place to connect with people that have our same struggles in a way that's not reassurance-seeking. Sharing our stories, listening to other people's experiences really makes you feel not alone. Also, trying to help people that post here really gives me insight on how to deal with my own struggles. It's always easier to help someone else rather than ourselves, so you can use that to really resonate around OCD in a way that's less anxiety inducing compared to when you need to deal with your own thoughts.

**Around ROCD (one of my main themes)**

* Your partner is a human. If you let ROCD run rampant in your relationship, if you confess a lot, if you break up as a compulsion, if you lash out and get aggressive because of intrusive thoughts you will hurt your partner a lot. A lot a lot. I empathize with you because I've been there multiple times, but we really need to make the effort not to bleed on the other person because of our wounds.
* Make a list of all the feelings that you think are wrong to feel in a relationship. A lot of common ones are boredom, irritation, anger. Try and make and effort to sit with those feelings instead of doing something about it. Make them part of your love life, not a deranged mistake that you make.
* Relationships are complex and OCD wants you to have 100000% certainty on a part of your life that can never be that certain. The difference between you and other people in a relationship is not that they are 1000% certain, it's that they are okay with that 1% uncertainty.

**Some other things that I think are generally helpful**

* **Stay the hell away from advice subs.** I made a whole post on it but you can probably guess why it's so bad for you.
* **Mindfulness activities.** I think these can be great once you're in a more stable place as they can be very triggering, because they make you much more aware of your intrusive thoughts. I've done the headspace course on anxiety once or twice and loved it. There's a lot of ways to meditate: being in nature and walking in silence, ""traditional"" eyes-closed meditation, meditative yoga etc.
* **Work on every other comorbidity you may have.** If you have more than one mental disorder, one may trigger the other and it can be a very frustrating experience. Even if you're fully recovered from OCD, being in the trenches with, say, an eating disorder makes it really hard for you not to relapse with OCD.
* **Cut social media time in half.** Or cut it off completely if you manage to. Mindlessly scrolling when you have OCD can be a legit DRUG. It makes you numb and it muffles the intrusive thoughts' noise. At one point my phone usage was 11 hours. It makes you stressed, anxious, feel less than, can give your brain fog... essentially the perfect mix for an OCD flare up.
* **Be consistent with therapy.** I think this point is so important. Even once you are recovered, it's still so crucial to go to therapy, even monthly is okay. My worst relapse happened because I could feel myself getting worse but I had been out of therapy for months and didn't want to admit to myself that I needed help again. Having that session every X days helps you check in yourself and catch relapses before they snowball.
* **Avoid confessing.** I know OCD makes it seem only logical to tell your SO /family /friends about your intrusive thoughts so that you do the ""right"" thing and tell them ""the truth"". This only impacts negatively your relationships. Telling everyone each of your intrusive thoughts only makes you feel better for 3 seconds and has no real use in your life unless you're telling them to a therapist. It can lead you to really hurt your loved ones feelings, for example with ROCD. Your partner can feel very hurt listening to the intrusive thoughts, even if they have no meaning.
* **Live your life.** I'd like to conclude on this note. OCD makes you feel like you have a massive obstacle in life and that doing ""big"" things can be too much of a risk. Challenge that. Go on trips, make experiences, try a million hobbies and meet a million people, live your life to the best you can even if there's OCD. Bring it along for the ride. And that's because you have two choices : either agreeing with OCD and give up on your life, or bring the fucker with you for the ride. Having a life full of things to do is a much greater enemy to OCD.

**What I think about the most popular accounts on OCD**

* Mark Freeman - not a therapist but has never claimed to be one. He gives great advice that is based on evidence, his videos are super entertaining to the point that I was following him out of curiosity rather than a need to deal with my OCD. He can explain extremely complex subjects in a very simple way and I think that’s an absolute gift.
* Anxietyjosh - Really like him. I don’t particularly enjoy his format per se, the kind of account that posts a million tweets with these truth nuggets that are of course very heplful, but it gives a lot of chaotic energy lol.
* OCDrecoveryuk - Just no. He’s a scammer and has in general proved to be a very sketchy guy all around. If you want to know more, try to search his name in this sub , the story is way too long for me to write it here.
* NOCD - I know that there are very mixed reviews about their therapy services but I never tried them so I can’t say. I found the app to be very helpful, it’s very nice to have your own app with erp exercises, community threads, SOS support etc. I’m really interested to try one of their support groups in the near future.
* Awaken into love - This is a very hard one for me. On one hand, this is one of the first, if not the first channel, that brought awareness around ROCD and I know so many people in this community will be forever grateful for that. My problem with her is that even if she’s never far off with her explaining of OCD, I find that her solutions are a little odd. It seems like she often transforms OCD from an individual problem to a couples problem and I think that’s a little dangerous. She talks a lot about deepening connections, opening up more, putting the work in your relationship and that’s awesome, but it’s not really the point to me when it comes to OCD. OCD is an individual problem, it’s not a problem of the couple. Don’t get me wrong, everythings she says I think it’s 100% spot on and it’s wisdom everyone should reflect on. But all of this talk around relationship hardships to me relates more to relationship anxiety…?
* Obsessivelyeverafter - certified therapist with a past with OCD. Love her, honest and trasparent and isn’t afraid to show the dark parts of OCD.
* Youranxietytoolkit - OCD specialist on ig. Recommended!
* Sheeva Rajee (shrinkwrap) : another big name regarding ROCD. I feel like she’s more focused on CBT, ERP based recovery than Kiyomi . I feel like she balances the wisdom part around relationships in general and knowledge around OCD well. I haven’t read her book yet but I’ve heard fantastic things.

Other accounts I really like: OCD and Anxiety on youtube, theocdstories podcast, jenna overbaugh, ocdoodles, ocdexcellence, anxiouslovecoach

EDIT: I'm going to add a few things that were brought up in the comments that were really good points, as well as some other things I wanted to add.

**What about medication?** Medication can be great and very effective for OCD. I 100% think that if you want to go on medication you should also pair it with therapy , in fact it's the standard advice that professionals give, but medication can really help you not hit extreme lows. I personally just have a benzodiazepine that I use when I have severe anxiety, I initially wanted to go on medication but I have a few other meds that I'm on for other health conditions that are already giving me side effects, so the worry was that mixing them would cause more harm than good. However, if I ever feel like the benefits would be higher than the ""risks"" I'd gladly take them. I also think you can recover without meds! They are an awesome tool, and it's your choice wether to use it or not. If you are on the fence about this, your therapist or family doctor can help you.

**What if I can't afford therapy?** This is, sadly, the case for many. I also had to stop for a while because of the cost and going back made me feel extremely guilty and anxious about the financial side of it. Given that mental health shouldn't be a luxury and it's beyond cruel that to get the right treatment you have to pay unspeakable amounts of money, there are some options.

1. First of all, look up if there is any kind of sliding scale / free limited sessions program in your country. This varies a lot from place to place.
2. Secondly, we luckily have a lot of books that were written by therapists or fellow sufferers that are absolute gems and that walk you through your OCD recovery. I'll put a list of my favourites below. I have read a lot of them especially when I wasn't in therapy and they are amazing, I now use them as reminders whenever I feel worse, because they condense a million things on OCD in very simple explanations.
3. Support groups. There are online support groups popping up everywhere nowadays! NOCD has a lot of support groups for a lot of OCD subtypes.
4. The NOCD app. Like I said in my first points, you can self administer ERP if you don't have a very hard time with it. I'd **definitely** avoid it if it triggers you to the point of not functioning or wanting to harm yourself , but if it triggers your anxiety in a ""reasonable"" amount,  I'd say go for it. They have this ERP exercise layout that is super cool and that makes you track your progress. They also have some resources to help you during a crisis and a community chatroom.

Ok_Band2802,"I've done a lot of CBT and ERP therapy for my OCD and made great strides. The more I speak with my CBT /ERP therapist and talk to friends who came from backgrounds of abuse, the more I have journaled and pieced together that my OCD really started when I was 9 years old as the result of multiple traumas at home.  
I witnessed a lot of distressing things as a kid, my folks had major mental health problems and addictions, no money, and there was emotional abuse and manipulation from my parents and older sister.   
I've started doing EMDR therapy for trauma, I just had my first intro session today.   
It is really scary to go into the past and it stirs up a lot. For me, it is *much scarier* and harder to do that childhood trauma work than the ERP or CBT.

v0rtexpulse,"Hey everyone,
I just wanted to share a bit about where I’m at right now, and maybe someone can relate or has some encouraging words.💕 I feel like maybe the fear is tricking me. 

I have a bad fear of throwing up (emetophobia) and my ocd revolves around that.

Since Wednesday, I’ve been going to a day clinic every weekday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. to try and work on my emetophobia and OCD. It’s a huge step for me, because up until now, I’ve been really inactive and very depressed—like lying in bed 18 to 20 hours a day kind of inactive. So this has been a major shift. Of course most of it due to the fear.

The clinic isn’t specifically for emetophobia or ocd. it’s more general mental health, so I’m with around 40 other patients. They do offer things like art therapy, some relaxation practices, and one-on-one therapy (but only once a week for about 30 minutes). There’s also a general doctor, nurse and some other staff you can talk to. But they haven’t really taught me any concrete skills yet for dealing with the phobia.

One thing that’s been especially hard is the lack of understanding around emetophobia. On my second day there, someone casually said something like “Oh no, someone’s got a bug again,” and it completely triggered me. I asked to go home.
The staff asked me „what happens when u get ill? you also get better again.“ while i was sobbing in the hallway where everyone could hear and see me having a menty B. I was so embarrassed but i couldnt hold it back no more.😕 

I had to sit in the lounge area for three hours trying to calm down with a stress ball and music. Staff and some co-patients were supportive in a way, but I still felt really alone with what I was experiencing. Like they told me “Avoidance isn’t going to help,” which is true!!! —but also, they didn’t seem to get just how intense it is. How touching things, or seeing someone walk toward the bathroom, can feel like my heart is about to stop. People there get Ketamine therapy and constantly complain about stomach aches afterwards too.

I’ve also struggled with food—my phobia has made me restrict eating at times—and now at the clinic I have to eat their lunch every day, in a busy loud room, which is really overwhelming. I did eat everything every day there but it’s just… not easy?

No one has really explained how to cope with that yet.

So I’m stuck wondering: is this place helping me, or is it making things worse? There’s another clinic I know about, a residential one with a whole emetophobia-focused station and a doctor who specializes in it. But that would mean leaving home, staying there full-time, and it feels like a huge leap. I’m scared I’m just “OCD doubting” everything again and that I don’t know what the smart choice is.

It’s Sunday afternoon right now and I feel that anxious feeling like when you don’t want to go to school. I know routine is good for me, and some parts of being there are nice, but I also feel like I’m drowning and not really being heard, it‘s like I‘m just waiting around all day.

And tbh i am just so exhausted. I am morbidly obese and the lack of activity is of course now showing, like everything HURTS. I just feel so defeated right now and i know if i tell the staff they wont understand.

I guess I just needed to get this out somewhere where people might really get it. Thanks if you read all of this.

Gold-Ad-5124,"TLDR; My anxiety/agoraphobia/OCD is essentially ruining my life. But I have a phobia about medications, too, so I’m just withering away. Looking for words of encouragement or success stories to try and help motivate me to take the leap and take my medications.

Hi everyone, this is going to be obnoxiously long and likely all over the place. But I’m at my wits end. For context, I am a 28 year old F. I have a bunch of things I’m diagnosed with, however, my most severe and debilitating ones are OCD, panic disorder and agoraphobia. I also am petrified of any form of medication (hence the pharmacophobia in the title.) I also am finishing my masters degree in psychology and am a school counselor at an alternative school.

All of these things started around 6 years ago. Prior to that I’ve been on a plane, by myself and with others. I’ve driven to NYC and RI when I was younger. I used to be able to take advil if my head hurt or antibiotics if I needed… I’m not sure what happened. But suddenly everything changed. I started not being able to travel outside of my town. I stopped taking any medication for fear of having bad reactions or allergic reactions.. even though I’m not allergic to anything.

When I try and think deeply about where all of these things started I THINK I’m able to come up with a few ideas. When it comes to agoraphobia I believe it was just before Covid started. I was on my way home from a fair with my friend and we got lost. We were in an area with no service so the GPS wasn’t working and there weren’t any stores around. I had the most debilitating panic attack of my life. Then Covid happened and everything shut down. So I think that started to solidify the thought that leaving was bad???? When it comes to the medication.. the ONLY thing I can think of is this: I worked at an inpatient psychiatric unit for five years. While there I saw a few paradoxical effects of medications. If you’re unfamiliar it’s the opposite effect of a medication. I became so petrified of that happening to me and I was so scared of going through a psychosis.

Rationally, I know the likelihood of that happening is slim to nothing. And I know that even if it DID happen I would be able to get better once I stop taking that medication. But my irrational brain takes over and prevents me from taking anything.. I ended up in the hospital 3 years ago with a UTI and needed to take antibiotics. They gave me one in the emergency room and put in an order for me to pick up at pharmacy. I cheeked the one in the ER and spit it out when I got in my car. I was so petrified. I picked up the meds at the pharmacy and I did end up taking them. But every time I took them I would have a panic attack that lasted HOURS.

Now back to the agoraphobia. During covid I worked  about 3 minutes from home. So I would go to work and go home. I worked 3-1130 and would stay up most nights until 5/6am then sleep until 2:30 right before work. I never left my town because everything I need is there. My family, my job, stores I’d need, doctors office, everything. I never had a reason to leave.

I want to experience things. I want to travel again and go on a plane to Disney. I want to go see Hamilton on Broadway. I want to be able to drive the 25 minutes to the dang beach. And I can’t even drive to the next town over without hyperventilating and sobbing and having out of body experiences. It is so embarrassing. My cousin who lives in Texas called me the other day saying she got engaged and I’m a bridesmaid so she needs me to get there. When I feel pressure like that it makes me feel worse. It also makes me feel so ashamed or myself and guilty. My fiancée (who is AMAZING and has never pushed me out of my comfort zone and who understands and cherishes me) graduated college back in October and his graduation ceremony was about an hour away. I couldn’t go to that and I felt so disgusted with myself. His whole family came to my college graduation (same town that I live in) and I just felt awful I couldn’t go to his. I did watch the live stream of it and was so proud of him. His mom is wonderful, too, and never makes me feel bad. But I know his brother doesn’t love it because he doesn’t understand mental health.

I’m just at the point where I don’t know what to do. Well, no, I KNOW what to do, but I just can’t fucking do it because my brain hates my guts. I know I need to take my medication (prescribed sertraline daily and Ativan as needed) but I just fill the prescriptions and they sit in a drawer. I’m begging you please if you’ve had bad reactions to those meds don’t tell me because I will convince myself it will happen to me and make my chances of never taking them bigger. If you’ve have good reactions and they’ve helped though I’d be happy to hear about it if you’re comfortable sharing. I know the only thing that will help is the medication. I try exposure therapy but I get right over the border into the next town and turn around before I get to the point of a panic attack. I don’t think I’m ever going to get better. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go into the city to see the aquarium or a concert. I don’t think I’ll be able to go to Disney ever or go to my cousins wedding. And I can’t stop crying every time I think about these things because I feel so useless. So unbelievably useless. To the point I’ve thought about leaving my fiancée so he can find someone that will be able to travel with him. I feel like I’m holding him back so much and it breaks my heart. I feel like I’m burdening my family because I can never go to events if they invite me, or if they want to do dinner they always have to come to me since they’ve all moved away. Not far, but not close enough for me to get to.

I convince myself on a regular basis I’m going to take my meds. I took two months off of work last year and used FMLA because I convinced myself if I didn’t have work I would be able to take my medications since I’d be at home and wouldn’t have to worry about calling out of work if the medications made me not feel good. I spent my whole 2 months off “tomorrowing” the meds. I never took them. I tried to even start with vitamins and I couldn’t even take the vitamins. Now that I work at a school I’ve convinced myself over the summer I will take my medication. But I’ve had the chances during all the school breaks to take them and haven’t. And what’s worse is when I was about 17 I took these same medications!!! I took sertraline and never had bad reactions to it. And it helped with my depression. But no matter how many times I remind myself I’ve taken it before.. my brain says “yeah but this time you’ll get sick or go into psychosis.”

My therapist said my OCD is what triggers these perseverating and intrusive thoughts. They literally play over and over in my head if I think about something that makes me anxious. From the second I wake up to the second I go to sleep. It’s so debilitating. And then I feel like a hypocrite because I convince other people to take their medications and help other people through their panic attacks but I can’t help myself. Like how messed up is that??? I don’t practice what I preach. Within the last year or two my OCD has started sending me into spirals when even other people are traveling somewhere. No clue where tf that stems from or why tf that had to happen. But if I know someone is going on a plane somewhere I will perseverate for weeks about it. It doesn’t matter if they say they’re going somewhere in six months… every day until that date comes I think about it and panic about it. And then when they’re there I panic some more and count the days until they get home. I imagine calling them and begging them to just come home early (doesn’t matter who it is. It could be someone I barely know). But I don’t do that obviously because the rational part of my brain is like “that’d be so embarrassing they’d talk about you doing that for the rest of your life.” A friend I’ve had for years and years told me last year she was moving to the UK within the next couple of years. Never told me a date or anything. But I stopped answering her after she told me and she blocked me on everything because of it. I was so anxious about knowing she was moving that I felt if I didn’t speak to her or see anything about her I would forget. You know, out of sight out of mind? Nope. I still wonder if she’s moved yet and panic about it. So I’m a terrible friend on top of everything else. Instead of just telling her I didn’t want to know when she leaves I became an awful person who ghosted her because I was more concerned about how embarrassing it would be to explain my anxiety.

I’m not really sure where else to go with this. There’s so much more I could say. But this is so raw and real and I’m being so vulnerable (which is scary to do on the internet) but I just don’t know where else to turn. Only select few people know just how deep my issues go.. I just really need some encouragement I guess??? If that’s even possible???? I feel as if I should’ve never gotten a psych degree because I can’t even help myself with one so why would I expect to be able to help other people?

Ugh okay I need to stop. Has anyone ever had anything even remotely similar? Or am I absolutely cooked?? I would love success stories to help motivate me to at least try the medications. Or other ways that you’ve overcome agoraphobia/OCD?",2025-03-28 06:21:34,Texas,1,1jliuzy,1,OCD,OCD/agoraphobia/pharmacophobia,1.0
MullerDoskov,"Initially I would like to clarify what should be obvious: OCD is not a ""nice thing"", it is a serious disorder that, when left untreated, can result in serious damage to a person's quality of life - People with OCD are much more prone to abuse drugs, develop depression, commit suicide, etc.

&#x200B;

Having said that, I would like to know if, with all the challenges, there are any advantages that you attribute to OCD.

&#x200B;

I work as a Middle Office analyst, my work involves a lot of programming, data manipulation and structure creation. Thus, I would attribute one of the fundamental aspects of the success I have had in my career to my perfectionist and meticulous profile.

I would say that my ""ability"" to structure projects, refine models and processes as much as possible is vital to my performance.

&#x200B;

But as everything has its downside, these same traits are what often make me get stuck spending a lot of time on tasks and ideas that have little or no practical importance, and also what makes me extremely unmotivated when I realize that a task will not be ""perfect"" or ""the way I wanted it"".",2023-08-24 03:45:01,Unknown,65,15zilnz,33,OCD,Are there any advantages you attribute to OCD?,0.97
Sure-Set-7578,"My experience…

So I don’t know if this is the right sub but just wondering if anyone can relate to my experience…

When I was 16 I got my first boyfriend. He was insanely abusive, and insisted that I tell him everything that happened during my day. I started journaling every detail of every day, every thought, every move I made so that I could report to him every night. Sometimes I could find a loophole, just make a vague comment pertaining to an event, but I was so obsessed with not “hiding” anything from him, I was miserable. 

I ended up giving birth to our daughter when I was 18, and stayed till I was 21. 

Once I left him I immediately became addicted to meth and every relationship I found myself in after that was also abusive. Meth dulled the chatter in my head, the constant need to “confess” my every thought. I had periods of sobriety, and many relapses. I’m now 35 and I’ve been clean and with the love of my life for 2 years. He is in no way abusive, he’s incredible, but I constantly battle the insane need to confess to him all of my sins. What I’ve done, thoughts I’ve had, war stories, all the ugly bad stuff about me. I assume I do it to see if he will love me despite the  life I lived before we met. The homeless, absent mother, junkie life. 

He constantly reassures me that he doesn’t want or need me to tell him those things but if something triggers a memory, I obsess over it until I confess. I tell myself over and over that everything is fine but it cycles through my brain to the point I can’t function until I say it out loud. I’ve been diagnosed with a lot of things, BPD, depression, anxiety, but I’ve never told anyone about this or known how to put it into words, so I never considered OCD until now. 

Anyways, just curious to know if anyone else has had a similar experience and how you may deal with it. ",2025-02-28 03:53:09,Unknown,1,1izs9x9,6,OCD,My experience,1.0
Antique-Ad2252,"So to start I don’t have a formal diagnosis OCD. When I went for therapy a year ago they said it was more likely OCD that I was suffering with and not just anxiety and depression which is probably why talking therapy never helped me this much. For the most part, it has always been health based or choking or that was the easiest to recognise as irrational and not based in reality and I had actual  routines that reduce this anxiety. I’m currently on the waiting list for a OCD type of CBT but a long wait because I’m in the UK. I don’t think I’ll ever seek a formal diagnosis as again, from the UK and besides some mental torture I’ve been pretty ok. 

I’m getting married to my partner this year and for the last 6 months I have been depressed and irritated at her because all that plays in my head constantly is that I don’t like her and that I am going to be stuck with her and then I feel guilty and shame because I don’t want to feel like that and I’m panicking because I don’t understand how my brain can say something that I don’t want to be true but then I do feel annoyed at her a lot of the time but I don’t think it’s her I think it’s me. 

I’m scared it’s working or it’s true as I’m having such a hard time differentiating between it being my real feelings and an anxious thought and I don’t know how I’m supposed to tell.  I have started trying to just counteract the thought in my head by saying this ain’t true and she hasn’t done anything but I just feel so stressed out and confused. This didn’t start happening really until we got engaged in august it was like one random thought that now bugs me everyday and I can’t cope. 

I don’t want to break up with her and I do think I want to get married but now I’m not sure and I now feel just paralysed with this fear of not knowing what is real or not.

Adventurous_Sell_568,"I'm posting as I find myself at a crossroads and uncertain of how to proceed. I have been in a relationship with my current partner for 4.5 years, and early on, I recognized signs of OCD. After reflection and research, he has acknowledged his mental health struggles. To provide some context, he experiences contamination OCD, compulsions related to religious practices (such as excessive praying and distress over whether he has prayed properly), and an overwhelming fear that his food may be drugged, which leads to concerns about becoming high and potentially experiencing psychosis. 

Given my own experience with three immediate family members who also have OCD, I understand the importance of addressing these issues. Without intervention, I believe his obsessions and compulsions will only continue to intensify and have an even greater impact on his life. 

I have repeatedly encouraged him to seek therapy, to the point where I have lost count of how many times I’ve asked. About a year and a half ago, he attended therapy briefly but stopped when the exposure therapy triggered really bad anxiety. I have witnessed firsthand the challenges my family members have faced in managing their OCD, and I empathize with how difficult this process can be.

However the ongoing struggles have begun to take a serious toll on my wellbeing as well. He has said for about three years now that he will go to therapy or do something to help himself—yet he continues to insist that he is unable to do so. He remains consistently anxious and moody. I recently cancelled a vacation because I simply don’t feel equipped to manage his anxiety any longer. Without going into detail, I am concerned he is on the verge of a breakdown and I don’t know what to do.

I have done my best to support him, but I am now unsure of how to proceed. I have clearly communicated the need for therapy, but my requests seem to have little impact. I am reaching out in the hopes of gaining insight into how I can move forward in a healthy way, both for him and for myself.

This might be a TL;DR post, but if you have even a glimpse of curiosity, I encourage you to give it a read. I am confident enough to say: it will be worth your time.

Greetings from Malaysia.

I am 39/M and have been battling OCD for nearly my entire life. I was diagnosed at 17 by professionals, but the signs had been there long before. Severe OCD led to depression, which then cycled into severe depression—a relentless loop that has dictated my life. I've undergone treatments like TMS, CBT, ERP, and a significant amount of medication. Suicidal ideation has been my companion for at least 25 years—where the thought of ""I hope I don't wake up anymore"" became routine. I attempted once last year.

OCD has impacted every facet of my existence: Academics. Career. Relationships. Health. Social life. Daily routine & self-care. Financial stability. Sleep and rest. Personal growth and hobbies. Emotional and spiritual well-being.

I could go on about my battles, but my main intent is not to tell a story or to vent. I am here to share what I believe we, as sufferers, truly are:

* We are Warriors!
* We do not give up easily. Even when we feel we are at the end of our road, even when giving up on life seems like the only way to end our mental torment—we still somehow forge a path beyond it. And for those who have lost their battle, they did not “fail.” They fought a supreme war that few can fathom.
* We may be some of the kindest, most understanding, most conscientious people in existence. Why? Because we are haunted by the fear of doing harm. We overanalyze our words and actions to ensure we never cross a line.
* It is hard for us to live, hard for others to live with us, and ironically, hard for us to die as well.
* We strive for perfection, even knowing “nothing is perfect.” Our mindset? ""There is always a closest point to perfection.""
* We rarely, if ever, think we are good enough. But that means we embrace constructive criticism, analyze it, improve, and move forward.
* We possess an unparalleled level of courage. Contamination OCD sufferers, for instance, will face extreme distress just to seek help from places like hospitals or undergo the brutal exposure of ERP therapy.
* We are humble to our core, yet when we are confident in something, that confidence is unshakable—because it was built through trials of fire, not handed to us.
* We have endured the worst, so we appreciate the best—no matter how small.
* We are masters of adaptation. Over time, we develop countless coping mechanisms—some that work, some that fail, some that serve us for a while before expiring and needing to be replaced. The mental effort required to keep finding new ways to navigate life is exhausting, but it also speaks to our relentless will to survive and function despite the challenges we face.
* Our minds are both our prison and our sanctuary. OCD traps us in relentless loops of doubt and fear, but it also gives us incredible depth of thought, creativity, and awareness that many don’t possess.
* We are warriors of the unseen. Unlike physical ailments, OCD is invisible. Most of the world doesn’t see the battles we fight every single day, yet we keep fighting nonetheless.
* We find strength in the smallest victories. What seems effortless to others—leaving the house, resisting a compulsion, sleeping through the night—can feel like climbing a mountain for us. And yet, we do it. Again and again.
* Many professionals who provide help for OCD struggle to keep up with the disorder’s complexity. OCD is just too intricate, too deceptive, too relentless. It evolves, morphs, and finds new ways to trap us, making it difficult for even the most well-trained professionals to fully grasp what we endure. And yet, we appreciate those who listen, who try to understand, and who make the effort to help—because even the smallest effort can make a difference.
* Although we may have been given functional eyes, ears, arms, and legs, we live with a mind that often feels faulty, broken, or against us. And yet, these very senses and abilities, which are meant to help us experience the world, sometimes seem to do us more harm than good. OCD manipulates what we see, hear, and feel—turning the good into something sinister, twisting the innocent into something terrifying. It makes us doubt reality itself. It makes us question: ""Why?"" Why must we fight so hard just to experience the life that others seem to navigate with ease? And yet, despite these questions, we push forward, searching for meaning, for healing, for moments of peace.

The list goes on...

I consider us superhuman in many ways. Our hypersensitivity to everything around us, our relentless resilience, our ability to keep moving forward despite the weight we carry.

So, to every OCD sufferer reading this:

You are stronger than you think. You are braver than you feel. You are more resilient than you believe.

Even on your darkest days, remember—you are still here. And that, in itself, is a victory.

The list could go on forever, but I’ll leave it here for now. If anyone wants to ask or discuss more, I’m open to an AMA. Feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to share and connect.",2025-03-01 13:30:49,Malaysia,0,1j0ujiv,2,OCD,39 Years Battling OCD—A Note to Every Sufferer: You Are Unbreakable,1.0
gigantoor1,"The hard realization that I have very bad anxiety and probably have had it all my life has hit me square in the face today. 

Up until this point I've looked at my cannabis addiction, my infatuation with Xanax, my propensity to drink heavily, each as mutually exclusive of one another because their respective effects were so different, and I picked the habits up at different points in my life. Smoking weed began in college. It was always hard for me to say that I smoked weed to cope with anxiety because I was smoking heavily before I even knew or could identify what anxiety was. Plus I have read how researchers are unsure whether people consume cannabis because of anxiety, or cannabis consumption causes anxiety. Drinking alcohol began in high school for fun, but basically from 18 to 28 years of age, I would drink very heavily and often to blackout. The relief that Xanax brought me in my mid-30ths was my first indication of what anxiety is and that maybe I have it. When I take Xanax I became incredibly productive which, through anecdotal evidence I read about on Reddit, I understand to be uncommon. As Xanax tamed the anxiety in my bones, something I had lived with for so long I was unaware it even existed, it also opened my eyes to the realization of what an entirely different life could be like. 

I stopped consuming cannabis almost 8 weeks ago (woohoo!) and I stopped drinking around 7 weeks ago. Since stopping cannabis, I have been taking Xanax daily - approximately 1.5-2 mg spread throughout the day, sometimes at night to help me sleep. I am in the process of tapering off it. Last night a buddy was in town and we had some drinks! It was all good, I welcomed the break. However today I recognized the exact same kind of productivity during my mild-hangover as I do when I take Xanax. My brain was less busy and I was doing the mundane chores I always put off and doing them while feeling relaxed. Overall it felt like I was moving through the day less frenetically. I'm aware that benzodiazepines and alcohol are in the same family but I have never experienced a similar effect between the two substances until today. 

This leads me to conclude, and maybe the few of you who are reading this are face palming yourselves because of how obvious it should have been, that yes I have bad anxiety, yes I've probably had it since childhood (I had undiagnosed OCD as a kid), and yes I likely used/use cannabis and alcohol in such extreme ways to mask this anxiety. I am by no means struggling, I am a very fortunate individual, but I haven't been able to excel in life as an adult at all. I don't consider myself successful, and because I was such an over-achiever through high school now as an adult this thought depresses me on the daily. I have addiction issues all over the place. I feel like all I do in this world is consume and provide nothing of real value or substance. I can't wrap my head around how everything in our American culture seems to revolve around making more and more money but yet people seem to readily accept this. I simply cannot figure a way to move through this world in an enjoyable and fulfilled manner.

Besides obsessively working out, how do you all cope with anxiety? I know it's a simple question with complex answers. I'm just feeling shook right now because today it officially dawned on me that without a plan (or unhealthily medicating myself) there's a good chance I won't be able to pull myself out of this anxiety hole.

I am currently prescribed stimulant medication for ADHD, so I take 10-20 mg of Vyvanse daily. Admittedly I'm not even sure I have ADHD. I was diagnosed in my 30s as a result of not being able to get anything done at work.",2025-02-26 23:59:48,Unknown,0,1iyui59,1,OCD,Coping with Anxiety - Advice Needed,1.0
Tiny-Lengthiness3960,"I was one of Robert Bray’s moderators that left. I want to share my story from start to end, sorry it’s long but hopefully it will help others gain insight into the true nature of OCD Recovery UK, a seductive online modern day cult that I got sucked into. (See comments for evidence).

I came in to Rob after having hit a dead end in my recovery journey, having already had very ERP-centric therapy (which helped to a significant degree) and followed him on social media for a while, the idea of getting under all my fears and embodying unconditional acceptance so nothing could ever ‘latch’ again was very appealing to me.

I was pretty skeptical at first since he had absolutely no qualifications whatsoever and the claims were almost too good to be true, but he was able to describe the OCD experience so well and his own ‘story’ of finding the ‘key’ to recovery along with other ‘success stories’ had pulled me in. Rob soon won my confidence with his charisma and we started to build a rapport. I joined one of his WhatsApp groups, and it felt great to be in a group with others going along the same journey.

The whole idea of unconditional acceptance as presented was alluring, seemed to make sense, and I was told that once I ‘embodied’ it and became ‘rational’ like him my OCD wouldn’t stand a chance! Just the idea that I had finally found the answer to my OCD filled me with hope.

Red flags such as him rescheduling some of my initial (very expensive) sessions after they should have started and gossiping about people in my group (even sharing very personal information) were ignored, in my mind here I was with the real deal, the one man who finally had the key to my recovery.

I got stuck into his book list, and there’s no denying there was some helpful insight in there. It was pointed out how much fear of fear and social fears were playing a role in my OCD and I ought to dispute these fears, and was set all kinds of shame attacks such as asking for extra small condoms in my local pharmacy.

I gave it a good crack and after a few months I felt I made a significant step forward in my recovery process. Not much longer after that I was asked to do a recovery story for his Instagram page.

Conflicted as I felt far from recovery but was also told I would be giving hope to others, I accepted. I was told to be sure to mention I went to a leading center before coming into Rob (at the time I believed this was giving ‘hope’ to those caught in a similar situation). In hindsight, soliciting this testimonial was highly unethical in the first place.

It wasn’t long after before I was asked to be a moderator, at this point I had lost my job due to the pandemic and truly think Rob is the man changing OCD, I gladly accepted. I was added to more and more WhatsApp groups, and asked to make videos and write articles in my own time for his platforms, as well as answer questions in some of his weekly group calls. I would be paid a small sum for my contributions, I felt I was moving in the right direction in my journey and moreover I was told that in the future people will look back at him and our videos as the point when OCD changed. The idea of this made me feel great, I had always wanted to give back to the community and I was fully on board the Rob train!

If someone criticised him on social media, he would give me the nudge to go defend him and off I would go! (In hindsight this is something I deeply regret, as I was unaware of how people were actually being treated). I wouldn’t be surprised to see one of his mods be sent to come defend him in this thread as they have (at times embarrassingly) attempted to do so on others.

At one point soon after, I started to stall, I doubted my progress. I was told that although I don’t feel it, I was just one shift away from full recovery, that of all his clients nobody had a better understanding of the concepts or was closer to full recovery than me. I was told I had 95% or more chance of making it, that ‘life would feel very different’ once I got there and that without the teachings of Albert Ellis it wouldn’t be possible. Crikey, I’d better crack on then!

Around this point I started a separate initiative in a foreign language raising awareness for OCD, ironically along with someone who had left the group because of ethical concerns regarding Rob and the compliance and devotion shown to him by a particular member of the group (who would even call him ‘our Jesus’). It was a random comment where Rob stated how irrational people were around the N word and literally just wrote ‘I hate n*****s’ completely unprompted and encouraged others to do the same, furthermore they had the audacity to talk of a book that wasn’t on the reading list and was told to stick to the list - that did it for them.

Thankfully we stayed in touch and I eventually actually did read that book, because I can honestly say it helped me far more than any of the other books on Rob’s list.

I wanted to get some training of some kind so I could properly help others in an ethical way. In my own time I had applied to an OCD course from a well known center, when I mentioned this to Rob he was furious. If I was to take this course, I couldn’t keep working with him. Rob had at some point had therapy with them, but his therapist who only helped ‘a bit’ was ‘a complete mess who still struggles a lot with her OCD’, what’s more ‘they wanted to go into business with him, but he turned them down, and now they are jealous of his success’. Besides, working with Rob was like taking a ‘£50,000 course for free’ and I ‘would only be teaching them about OCD’ (laughable when I look back). I pushed back, but ultimately conceded to the demands of my unqualified mental health coach to not get formal education at a place of my choosing.

At this point I was taking a deeper dive into ACT, largely behind the scenes because I knew Rob wasn’t much of a fan, and started to make more progress again. My role as a moderator was growing also and I was asked to be a speaker at many of the increasingly common webinars too. I still firmly believed at this point that when I fully ‘adopt’ this unconditional acceptance thingy that my OCD would finally be a thing of the past once and for all.

Then came a big setback. My POCD was back in full throttle. It was time to lean on Rob himself and book some £250 sessions, however trying to break down why if my fear was true it wouldn’t be scary when this anxious was clearly becoming compulsive. I was also internally beating myself up about how I, one of the leading pupils of the chosen son, could have such a strong relapse.

It was at this point I realised I needed to really cultivate self-compassion. In fact it was in large part the self-compassion and ACT tools that got me out of the hole (tools that frankly aren’t practiced in any serious way in Rob’s community). I actually got better guidance outside of Rob and his groups than within it. It also started to dawn on me it would be unlikely to fully be at peace with the worst case scenario of committing a pedophilic act that I hadn’t actually committed. I had been trying for over a year since I was only ‘one shift away’, and it was a neutralisation tactic (trying to prove I had nothing to worry about) that was fuelling my obsession (through rumination) more than anything else and me trying to eliminate fear from my life (after all I kept being told to ‘break down my fears’ as ‘if there was no fear there would be no suffering’).

Rob having told me from the start that medication wouldn’t be a good idea for me, suddenly one day said I should start taking a low dose of a specific medicine (something he is totally unqualified to do), even though I was stuck in a foreign country.

This is when I first started having some genuine reservations. I had thought I was in the upper echelons of knowledge in OCD by learning from Rob (as he strongly conveyed this to me, part of his brainwashing), yet it was clear there was so much more out there. The narrative of nobody else fully understanding OCD didn’t quite add up. I started reflecting on questions such as why has not a single person fully ‘recovered’ by ‘embodying’ unconditional acceptance except (allegedly) the good shepherd himself?

When I read properly into self-compassion and started practicing it properly I was blown away at what a powerful tool it was. What’s more it packages the concept of unconditional acceptance of ourselves and others in many ways more powerfully than the deified Ellis and his books, with a path to practice it non-compulsively.

I had put the tools Rob highlighted to me largely to oneside, not because I thought they were useless but because working on other tools was taking me further ahead at this point. Realising I didn’t necessarily need to be not scared of my worst case scenario and keep chasing this ‘key’ of unconditional acceptance to unlock my OCD to fully recover was a big step forward for me (yes, I understand acceptance is not agreement). I knew Rob disagreed but at the time I just put it down to a difference in perspective.

Though at this point the illusion of Rob being a uniquely knowledgeable OCD master that was bringing ‘OCD out of the dark’, had significantly began to wear down. The more I read from leading OCD specialists the more I realised there was so much more out there than just ‘thoughts are thoughts’ as he frames it, and the more I saw the helpful things I learned being covered about fear of fear, core fears, irrational/dysfunctional beliefs and exploring the worst case scenario, in a more skillful way that supported exposure instead of neutralisation. Moreover, sometimes I would hear him talk about things I had learned and practiced in more depth, eg. mindfulness, and cringe at his lack of understanding of it or at least very poor explanation.

Still, the man brought some decent insight to the table, insight that had (at least initially) helped me and ostensibly many others too. The opportunity to give hope and share what I had learned in my journey felt rewarding, moreover I felt as a moderator I had a voice to bring some of the aspects that Rob was missing into the mix.

Rob then decided I was ready to take on 2-1 calls with regularity. These calls would almost invariably end up with me doing 80%+ of the speaking, but this wasn’t an issue as I was happy to try help these people. I also had my last session with Rob during this time when I was having an anxious week (and my first session in around 4-5 months), I knew immediately after the call that it was the last, I simply wasn’t learning anything new, and it was the same lines on repeat: ‘rationally why would it be scary if you (insert pedophilic fear), it would just be a younger human?’ And that if he did it ‘there would be no emotional disturbance’ (something he had previously claimed would also be the case if he murdered someone as he was so ‘rational’).

It wasn’t before long I began to feel very uncomfortable regarding the 2-1 calls. These poor souls were paying an exorbitant fee to Rob (as it turns out in at least some cases £350) to listen to me explain often just the basics of OCD for 45 minutes and on at least one call I was presented as fully ‘recovered’, which made me uneasy. It got worse, when one client asked if they should visit a therapist to deal with their ‘trauma’, only to be told by Rob ‘don’t worry WE are specialists in everything relating to anxiety including trauma’, this made me very uncomfortable because frankly I am far from being remotely close to anything near a specialist in trauma (but at least know enough to know this) - and neither is Rob - yet I didn’t have the nuts to speak up.

Clients would also be told ‘everything you need is here, there is nothing we don’t know about’ and after the calls I would receive a message about how these people would have no chance of recovery if it wasn’t for us, stuff that would honestly make me cringe. Before one call I asked what kind of obsessions the client had and was informed ‘I can’t remember’ (so much for those detailed notes he claimed to take).

Concurrently I was doing a course to become a certified peer support specialist guided by a highly respected OCD center, of my own accord as the foreign language initiative we started had grown, and we wanted to ensure we were helping the vulnerable people coming to us on a daily basis in an ethical way. It was becoming clear that the ethics of OCD Recovery were significantly lacking. What’s more it was clear the depth of knowledge of those training me was far greater than Rob’s. By now I was considering my exit from the community, and becoming more flakey with videos and 2-1 calls.

What’s more, yet another person I know who had left the groups had made a full recovery, after deciding to ditch Rob’s approach entirely despite Rob doing his best to persuade them not to by saying it was just their OCD playing up and that it wasn’t a good idea to seek help elsewhere. In fact Rob had missed the entire problem, which a professional fully addressed in a matter of months.

At this point I have strong reservations but I still was grateful for some of the insight I had gained and fundamentally still believed Rob was trying his best to make a positive change in the community.

I was getting more frustrated and concerned about how many people were disputing irrational beliefs in order to neutralize their fears, often beginners in their recovery journey who didn’t have the basic psychoeducation in place or properly understand how to identify a compulsion and were clearly fuelling their obsessions. Furthermore it would frustrate me that people who had already read the books on the list multiple times, were being told to go revisit the scriptures once again as they ‘work for everyone’ and just didn’t quite get it yet. It got to a stage I was regularly recommending books to people, primarily on the backstreets (in private) as it was taboo to mention other books in group. It also concerned me when someone said they were anxious but didn’t do any compulsions and still had a great day, and the insinuation was they still needed to break down the fear, as if any anxiety is a problem regardless of not engaging in compulsions. It was almost set up so you couldn’t ever feel ‘fully recovered’ and were being taught to keep compulsing till you got there (which nobody ever seemed to be). He’d also proclaim he got people recovered from ‘themes’ even though their obsessions had just morphed.

Meanwhile at this point there is also a more public social media campaign against Rob, including amongst respected therapists. Whilst I was very concerned about the ethical component, and had reservations about elements of the approach; I actually felt quite defensive especially as I didn’t fully agree with some of the lines of attack. Neither did I appreciate being told I was in a cult (now I fully recognise it is one), as I did not feel I was part of one. I also wanted to stand up for members of the community who I had developed a strong bond with and still felt Rob was just trying to help people, moreover I remained grateful to him for having provided some helpful insight and an opportunity to give back to the community. I almost felt under attack myself, little did I realise people were just trying to safeguard and raise alarm bells and help people get out of a potentially very unhealthy situation. At the time some of these attacks initially pushed me towards not leaving. But Rob’s defences in group claiming he is the ‘most ethical’ and was ‘considering making a course on ethics for all coaches’, utterly absurd claims, were simultaneously having the opposite effect.

I had also spoken with others that I was friendly with about this in private, and more tales of Rob behaving in an unethical manner or simply saying something intellectually moronic (even from those who did not have an ostensibly negative experience) were growing. People were also saying that calls were cut very short, exposures were given way above one’s level (and no it’s not as Rob claims a ‘myth’ that exposures can set one back significantly, especially those with comorbid conditions) and that they were told not to read books that weren’t on the list, including calling a book on ACT (psychological flexibility) ‘rigid’ (the ignorance defies belief).

Due to the fact my workload had now increased elsewhere and my aforementioned reservations, I decided to inform Rob of my intention to leave the groups. I didn’t have the nuts to confront him about my ethical concerns, we still had a good relationship and at the time I didn’t believe these concerns to be exceedingly grave. Rob subsequently offered me a significant increase in how much he would pay me to be a moderator (£2,000/month), and said I didn’t have to do any moderating in the groups but to stay anyway as it wouldn’t ‘look good’ but my mind was made up to leave the following month.

I had decided to stay in the group calls and some webinars, honestly mainly because I felt if I left I would only be replaced by someone else who would likely give less varied advice. I felt the other speaker and I (Rob would often not turn up at all at this stage, not that attendees were advised) were able to give solid support, they’d tend to focus more on the Ellis stuff (by this point they honestly did it far better than Rob) and I’d increasingly try put more emphasis on other tools.

I remember around this time engaging in a debate with someone in the Facebook group about Rob’s methods and there were some things I simply couldn’t defend like where on earth the (in retrospect negligent) ‘dispute for 20 minutes a day’ rule came from. It dawned on me that I was no longer defending Rob and his claims of ‘unconditional acceptance’ being the ‘key’ to get ‘under all our fears’, but elements of REBT/unconditional acceptance that I thought (and honestly still think) can be helpful (if applied appropriately). Moreover his approach of disputing until you aren’t scared of any worst case scenario, inevitably becomes a fear based compulsive behaviour in itself that fuels the cycle - like a dog trying to endlessly chase it’s tail - as brains can always come up with something else.

The continuous quest to convince ourselves there is nothing to fear (as ‘anxiety doesn’t have a place in a truly accepting mind’) is treating anxiety as something that ought not to be experienced (even if this is sugar coated with more helpful advice such as meanwhile we should ‘bring it for the ride’), this is the opposite of acceptance and what got us stuck in the first place. The absence of fear does not define good mental health, and we don’t need to chase that rainbow to recover from OCD.

Around this time one of the ex-mods (a position they should never have been put in the first place), that I became friendly with that had been kicked out of the community months earlier, started to speak out publicly also. She was clearly hurting and wanted to be heard. I actually was familiar with large parts of the story, but they themselves had come to know that others had been through similar experiences. I came to know of more details, including Rob accepting money as an apology for being a ‘difficult’ client and frankly was taken aback by some of the screenshots of their conversations with Rob.

Something really didn’t feel right by now, and I was glad to finally exit all the groups - all done in an amicable manner. When I had left the groups, word got out on the ‘outside’ that I had left. More evidence came to my attention of highly unethical exchanges, eg. not refunding large amounts of money to someone in financial distress for untaken sessions even though sessions had been cut extremely short and terms + conditions weren’t presented, from different members of the community I had come to know. The cherry on top was a refusal to remove the video content made by my friend even though they never signed over the rights to it and desperately wanted it taken down.

I was fuming, I no longer wanted to be associated in anyway with his company and decided to politely confront Rob on a plethora of unethical practices. I informed him my position was untenable and I was stepping down entirely. By the time I next checked my phone, Rob had sent me 29 messages denying all wrongdoing (I do not exaggerate), although after the exchanges I had seen with others I can’t say I was surprised. I responded politely but firmly and the exchange ended up being cordial; we wish each other the best, went our ways quietly into the night and that was that…or so I thought….

Little did I know the plethora of even more shocking stories and screenshots. It all had a common thread of blatant manipulation of the vulnerable, especially females, and putting his ego and desire for money over the well-being of clients. It also wasn’t just the what, it was also that it was many of the people who I had been friendly with in the groups. He also went on and shared one of my articles on his Instagram stories. At long long last the penny had dropped, something rather sinister was going on.

At this point I was in great distress, I told Rob exactly what I thought. No holding back, it felt cathartic at first. Then (at this point as expected) the gaslighting began, it was as if the mask was off. Blatant denial of things I know to be true (eg that it’s ‘complete nonsense’ that he deletes negative comments on social media), a litany of absurd lies (eg that the hidden payment terms and conditions at the bottom of his website was a universal practice and that even the therapist center I went to previously do the same - of course they don’t as I had to sign a contract with them), claiming that I was engaging in ‘cancel culture’ and that the ‘rational’ thing to be saying was ‘thank you for getting me to recovery’. He was entirely unable to even entertain the possibility he did anything wrong let alone contributed to the significant psychological harm of many.

I asked for the content I contributed to be taken down from all his platforms, I was told I would need to pay money back for the videos made (even though I own the rights to them). I was then told to speak to a moderator who was also someone I had considered a ‘friend’ of mine, and I used to support doing his exposures, who I had thought of as a kind hearted soul who really wanted to help people. I was glad, they would be able to mediate and would naturally help their ‘friend’ who was desperate for the content they created and own the copyright for to be taken down. To my dismay this was not the case, all kinds of mental gymnastics were performed to defend Rob and I was told I was being done a solid by not being ghosted, with not much headway in removal of all my content (including plenty of stuff I did for free).

I had become aware there was a group for survivors of Rob and I reached out to the therapist running this support group to join it because at this point I felt tormented. The façade had well and truly been seen through, yet I still hadn’t seen the worst of it - I had actually only just seen the tip of the iceberg. I began to see the untold damage that was being caused not just by the ethics but also by the methods such as grossly mishandling comorbid conditions, as well as things I had previously overlooked such as people being taught that they must change beliefs that go against their values in order to recover from OCD and that ‘rationally’ nothing really matters in life (which flies in the face of our yearning for meaning and can lead to apathy). In hindsight I even look back and cringe at my inadvertent lack of compassion to friends and family that came to me when they were hurting by just robotically saying ‘rationally it’s not a big deal’, a sentiment I know many others share.

A documentary about predatory online mental health cures was also being made by the BBC (now released) largely centered around the experiences two of his ex-clients had with him. Funnily enough without mentioning his name, therapists from as far away as Mexico immediately had a strong hunch this was about Rob Prey himself.

The realisation that many others had been through what I was going through, that many ‘success stories’ actually weren’t so successful after all and wanted their content removed but wasn’t being taken down, the sheer lying about other’s stories that had spoken out beforehand, the fact he had been called out on all this before, the compulsive monitoring, gaslighting and attempted hoovering of many of those that leave or were pulling away from the community, the sheer quantity of those who had EXTREMELY short calls (and no, these weren’t ‘splitting sessions up’), the fostering of dependence, extremely inappropriate ‘exposures’, predatory procuring of clients, vulturine attempts to convert sessions, refusals to refund short/untaken sessions, flagrantly unethical solicitation of testimonials, complete disregard of client confidentiality, the manipulation for his financial benefit, the stories of people ending up attempting to take their own lives and many other sickening stories…it started to become crystal clear, I was just a new recruit to market his company and bring him more clients and hold up the false façade of Rob being some kind of OCD messiah. My mental health was only of ‘concern’ whilst I was an asset, now I wasn’t it was irrelevant and even the pretence of ethical standards had been thrown out the window.

After speaking to a lawyer I realized it would take a few months to raise the money and get my content taken down but that I had ownership of the copyright and a right for erasure. After my request for erasure was ignored as well as pressure on social media, which naturally ended up in a deleted comment as well as being blocked, I coughed up £460 to remove videos I put my hard work and time into (under the false pretence it was in the name of ‘changing ocd’), to my unqualified minted ex-mental health coach, many of which were amongst the most viewed from his channel (again all whilst owning the copyright).

I think the most painful part of all was watching my so called ‘friend’ mediate this without batting an eyelid. I even sent them a list of 65+ ethical issues with Rob and it was ignored. A few days later someone sent me screenshots (from one of the groups I left) of this so called ‘friend’ saying that there is nothing unethical going on and nobody is ever able specify to them what is unethical (and I know I wasn’t the only one to specify such issues in detail), and worst of all going along with Rob’s insinuations that I left because I had an ‘agenda’ by saying people didn’t know the ‘other stuff’ I was ‘up to’. When I confronted him on this I was told ‘toodles’ & blocked.

I was also sent screenshots of another moderator I was friendly with blatantly lying about me in order to protect dear leader. Another member I had supported in some of their darkest hours (despite Rob’s warning that she ‘likes being a drama queen’) attacked me, claiming amongst other things that I was ‘spreading hate’, for raising awareness and safeguarding (then proceeded to delete some of her own messages in a transparent indication of sending screenshots to dear leader; his approval is something many of his followers seek after). It was also difficult interacting with another moderator who whilst I don’t doubt they have the best of intentions was in denial to a point it was chilling. This along with educating myself further on cults is when it all dawned on me it clearly was in fact one. I had imagined cults to be groups of people with cloaks in the woods but this is what a 21st century cult looks like.

When I had started speaking out on social media, Rob had concocted a story in the groups that I left because I was ‘jealous’ (there’s literally almost nobody I can think of I would less like to be like) and that I had left to run my own ‘coaching company’, what’s more I had stolen all his ideas for a book and was now ‘making things up’ in a deliberate attempt to ‘trigger people’ and play on the ‘doubting disorder’ (the ultimate projection as his whole business depends on making people doubt anybody else can get you recovered but him, and any doubts you have about him are put down to ‘Rob OCD’). Bizarrely some of his best evidence against me was scrolling through my twitter comments (he doesn’t even follow me) and sending screenshots of a comment I sent to Mark Freeman about the steps he took to uphold his high ethical standards (who unlike Rob has had training).

All very familiar stories (that along with ‘they got triggered’ and ‘they are irrational’ are his go-to smears) as all the therapists (including the one providing entirely free support to survivors) who had spoken out happened to all be money hungry jealous people engaging in a ‘witch-hunt’ with a nefarious agenda to trigger people in his community based on a pack of lies (Rob’s prolific at smearing/discrediting those who speak out against him and at playing the victim).

The fact he compares his business to an initiative I help run trying to help those gain access to adequate help in an impoverished part of the world, that follows a strict ethical code, works alongside leading centers and therapists in the region, not to mention is in another language and almost exclusively provides free services (and the rest at low cost) - is laughable. The I stole his ideas in a book story is equally laughable, I was asked to co-author a small booklet (which we now pulled and are re-writing) - and when I sent a copy to Rob he was furious that the other author had quoted Mark Freeman (who he called his ‘competitor’) and not him and had a massive hissy fit till I sheepishly succumbed to his demands and added a quote of him too - the parts reflecting Albert Ellis teachings were a minority of the booklet and also a bizarre response from someone who claims his mission is ‘to bring OCD out of the dark’ with these very teachings. I was also told to be sure not to mention this booklet in his groups (and needless to mention I didn’t keep a single dollar of the very humble earnings).

At this point I was still struggling to get my head around it all. How could this all be possible? How could I have missed this all? How could I have been so naive? It all seemed so ridiculous - an unqualified guy on social media that has gone rogue and cracked one of the most common mental health conditions in the world - which he did by interpreting the work of one of the most studied psychologists, who’s work has been around for over 60 years, better than any professional (ironically including Albert Ellis himself).

More and more red flags come rushing to mind. The ‘book’ that was going to ‘change OCD’ he was writing (since over 4 years ago) that never came out. That interview on TV that got cancelled at the last minute. That ‘debate’ with Dr. Phillipson that never happened. The Ted Talks that never happened. The team of professional CBT Therapists that were being trained by him and would join his team that never happened. Private information about others that I was told and never should have been (like who visited sex workers and who he would like to date). The fact that nobody ever fully recovered according to his definition whilst he was proclaiming ‘the best results of anywhere in history’. Referring to leading voices in the community as ‘competitors’. That an alarming amount of leading voices had called him out. That even Albert Ellis himself admits he had great difficulty in treating OCD, and does not claim unconditional acceptance is the solution to complete recovery from OCD. The limited reading list without any OCD specialist or specific books and only one author that remains alive. The refusal to engage with the community at large. The outlandish claims of number of people coached (20,000+). The calls whilst he was walking around in public or eating. The ridiculous prices despite no investment in education and doing shorter voice calls…and so on and so forth.

Then there is the unique definition of recovery (he claims that completely giving up compulsions does not mean recovery as we still need to ‘get under’ all our fears so thoughts lose their intrusiveness and we do not feel ‘chronic’ anxiety). This is idiotic as by definition an OCD cycle needs compulsions to survive otherwise it wouldn’t have the word compulsive in it. Our brains literally can’t remain chronically anxious if not engaging in compulsions (including avoidance) over time as our brains learn from the behavioural change (hence why leading specialists don’t describe recovery like this). Rob tries to frame it that only this ‘not subjective’ definition of recovery gives ‘hope’ - utter nonsense - and uses the example of an alcoholic to justify this by saying recovery from alcoholism isin’t having a few drinks a day; ironically this highlights exactly the problem with his definition, as in OCD we are addicted to compulsions and NOT anxiety; recovery from alcoholism is giving up alcohol (not absence of ‘chronic’ desire to drink) just as recovery from OCD is giving up compulsions. The reduction in anxiety (or the urge to drink) is a natural by-product of this.

I did some more digging and found old tweets of him proclaiming that the therapist (that incorporates REBT into their treatment) for the OCD center that I had wanted to take a course with was ‘a pioneer in OCD treatment’, that got him ‘recovered’. I also found tweets of him openly claiming he provided therapy and he actually founded his company as ‘Mental Health Therapy Ltd’, which made me feel particularly dumb as I had been asked and sheepishly agreed to defend him in the past on the grounds he was ‘just a coach’.

I felt I had no choice but to post a list of red flags on my social media as a means to safeguard others in a potentially unhealthy situation. Fortunately and heartbreakingly, plenty of others that had kept their concerns to themselves felt heard and reached out. Many had only stayed out of fear of losing their one chance of ‘true recovery’, for many others the penny dropped and they found their way out of the cult.

At this point the dots had connected and it all started to become so obvious, I wonder how I ever bought it all in the first place (something that many feel when the penny drops and they get some space). But the charm and promises of a recovery where nothing could ever disrupt our inner peace again make us drunk. Confirmation bias is very powerful and this is exacerbated when we are in a group setting where Rob is continually praised (conformity bias). Moreover, we desperately want to believe in our own and particularly this kind of recovery, so there’s lots of resistance to coming around to the idea we have made a complete misjudgement, not to mention it all somehow seems unfathomable, making it difficult to see the wood for the trees. As someone wisely shared with me ‘the closer you are to darkness, the harder it is to see the light’.

Then I wonder how could anyone with OCD behave such a way & someone suggested he may have narcissistic personality disorder. After researching myself the match appears remarkably accurate, especially when you read about the combination of NPD + OCD.

I eventually got my content removed after paying for my own videos to be taken down, via several intellectual property rights reports on Instagram + Facebook and hired a lawyer so my articles would be removed from his website (even though I was being asked for money for those too). He could hardly have made it more challenging to have my rights upheld, in fact two of the only posts he did ‘remove’ (on Instagram), he subsequently unarchived. Ultimately, I was determined to take the necessary steps to get everything removed.

The only real question that is left for me is how much of this operation is calculated and how much is because they genuinely believe their narcissistic fantasy. I imagine it’s a mix of both.

As sinister as it may be there is an element of genius. Create a unique program that will ‘get you to get under all fears’ and recover fully from OCD 'once and for all’. Point people towards some helpful tools including ones that aren’t always covered elsewhere which buys them into the program, meanwhile create a dynamic that fosters and facilitates dependence on Rob and the groups, but most importantly create a program nobody has ever seemingly successfully graduated and got out (even if you are initially ‘helped’ like me, and there’s no denying some people are, you will likely become a servant or marketing tool). As someone aptly put it ‘he may save your life but then he won’t give it back’. Thereby both keeping perpetual clients and maintaining his status as the untouchable knowledge leader, all whilst telling people that they are learning to be ‘rational’ and that everyone else on the outside can’t understand because they are ‘irrational’.

Taking advantage of the vulnerable whilst also being sure to favouritise and groom certain assets (eg. his mods/disciples) who may act as enablers and can bring him supply (eg. money, attention, admiration, recognition, devotion) that affirms his grandiose false self-image as the saviour of OCD. Not to mention the same old faux-debunking against outside criticism eg. ‘they don’t understand the theory’ (even though unconditional self acceptance is about accepting yourself as you are, not as you are not - and it isn’t the books that are the problem it’s what Rob claims about them being the solution to rendering OCD ‘powerless’ where nothing could ever disrupt our inner peace again), hardly an accusation he can throw at me though.

Having seen what I’ve seen, I would say with confidence I am more recovered than he is. He may well feel less although this may be linked to his inability to feel empathy/other emotions properly but his compulsive behaviour is off the charts. He seems to spend his whole life obsessively on WhatsApp and social media even when he would randomly text me to tell me ‘he was in a club’ (I was in many of his groups, far more than an often struggling client on their recovery journey should have ever been in) and is constantly projecting and seeking affirmation of his idealised false self-image on these platforms (even all ‘free’ resources double up as a source of marketing/supply). Perennially on the hunt for whatever can portray him in a positive light even if it comes at the expense of his clients well-being.

Since moving away from this flawed approach, I haven’t felt this mentally healthy in a long time.

Whilst my anger, heartbreak and shame at being sucked in, brainwashed and promoting such a shady organisation has settled, I stand in solidarity with those who have been harmed and even those that are being manipulated but are still completely unaware of it. I have also learned a lot from my experience too, I honestly did not understand people like this existed.

I also despite it all can’t help but have some level of compassion for Rob too, behind the mask must be a colossus of insecurity, and an unwell man. However this does not excuse his nefarious behaviour and manipulation, and it’s frankly highly dangerous to have an untrained megalomaniac running a mental health ‘company’.

The fortunate thing is that people are increasingly aware of this issue, and are doing something about it. I would say with confidence the future doesn’t look great for OCD Recovery UK or Rob.

I hope this post can serve to help people either not get themselves into a sticky situation, get themselves out of one or validate some of those who have been affected by his ‘treatment’, as well as perhaps clearing the record on the lies told about me too.

I can assure you there is so much hope and help beyond that community. OCD very much is out of the dark, we just need to look in the right places.

ImpossibleBedroom468,"TLDR: The administration is undermining evidence-based mental health support, including for OCD. Call your members of Congress and tell the IOCDF to stand up.

\---

I have OCD. Years ago, I was spiraling. I was scared and confused. I genuinely didn’t know if I was going to make it. Today, my OCD is under control and most days I don’t even think about it.

Three things helped. First, when my anxiety was at its debilitatingly worst, I was prescribed an SSRI. This was a game-changer. I told my wife that it felt like the first time I put on glasses and saw what people with “normal” eyesight see. Except instead of clarifying my eyesight, it clarified my mind. This allowed me to pull back from the brink and do the hard work of ERP.

Second, of course, is the ERP itself. We know this is the “gold standard” for OCD treatment.

Third, is the information I could find online that led me to a qualified OCD therapist and helped me understand what was happening in my brain and how to address it. Much of that information came from places like r/OCD and the many other amazing online and in-person OCD communities (no reassurance-seeking!). Much of it came from reliable institutional sources.

But the institutions and policies that helped make these possible—SSRI access, evidence-based therapy, and quality information—are under attack.

We have the right to make decisions about our own mental health care according to the evidence and in consultation with our medical providers. We know that SSRIs are a critical, evidence-based treatment. But the new Secretary of Health and Human Services has [called people who take SSRIs “addicts”](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/kennedy-rfk-antidepressants-ssri-school-shootings/) and repeated lies such as that SSRIs cause school shootings. The federal government’s new “Make America Healthy Again Commission” [could end up limiting access to SSRIs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/#:~:text=(iii)%C2%A0%20%C2%A0assess%20the%20prevalence%20of%20and%20threat%20posed%20by%C2%A0the%20prescription%20of%20selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitors%2C%20antipsychotics%2C%20mood%20stabilizers%2C%20stimulants%2C%20and%20weight%2Dloss%20drugs%3B).

We have the right to have our money go to quality research projects to develop safe and reliable treatments. But [NIH funding to research organizations has been arbitrarily cut](https://apnews.com/article/trump-academic-research-funding-cuts-lawsuit-nih-fcdad42b9623305dd7ad8db4cff5fc1d). Much of the progress made in OCD treatment came thanks to NIH funding. Future progress will as well. [Just last fiscal year, the NIH funded 184 projects researching OCD treatments](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/OnXhRz_qIkGxFVzVKbycQQ/projects?fy=2024), including both on drugs (like SSRIs), behavioral therapies, and promising emerging treatment approaches. The cuts risk shutting these projects down midstream. Research like this isn’t like a car that you can just start and stop. If you interrupt it, you may lose all the progress (and the funding) to date.

We have the right to health information grounded in science. But within just weeks, the new administration has [removed official websites and webpages that contained important health information](https://www.reuters.com/legal/trump-administration-ordered-restore-us-health-agency-websites-that-were-2025-02-11/).

**1. Call your members of Congress and tell them to act to stop the cuts to NIH research funding**. Members of Congress have decided to not fulfill their Constitutionally-mandated duty to provide oversight of federal agencies or advice and consent on government officials. This is part of what has led to the reckless cuts in NIH funding. Our representatives have a responsibility to act on our behalf. Help them remember that and [find contact info for your elected representatives here](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials). The American Psychological Association [has helpful language about the funding cuts you can use during your call if you want](https://www.votervoice.net/APAAdvocacy/Campaigns/121382/Respond).

**2. Tell the IOCDF to stand up for evidence-based treatment**. The [IOCDF](https://iocdf.org/) provides crucial resources to people with OCD and helps speak for people impacted by OCD. Years ago, they helped me find a therapist trained in ERP. In case you missed it, they posted [a statement on their website](https://iocdf.org/blog/2025/02/14/iocdf-calls-for-continued-access-to-ssris-in-response-to-executive-order-addressing-youth-health/) calling for continued access to SSRIs in response to the “MAHA Commission” I referenced above. This is important and I thanked the IOCDF for it. If you feel inclined, I encourage you to do the same. But I have not seen a similar statement about the NIH funding and have asked them to speak up like many other mental health organizations, including the American Psychological Association, have already done.

**3. Tell your friends, family, and neighbors to do the same**. There is strength in numbers. Who do you know that can speak up with you? Ask them to do so.

One of the silver linings to come out of having OCD has been to meet the many amazing people in this community. Now get off this sub!",2025-02-18 07:54:04,Unknown,0,1is1z38,2,OCD,Also worried about access to your medication? Do something about it!,0.75
Interesting-Zebra-83,"BACKSTORY: For most of my life I’ve struggled with depression. When I was 18, I was trying to wrap up senior year of high school and was extremely depressed (I hated school, especially waking up so early. Lack of sleep drove me into insane meltdowns.) and eventually my OCD kicked in. I was abusing pornography and sometimes it didn’t always match my sexual orientation, so I had the thought “Am I gay?” and that snowballed and it destroyed my life for a few months.

Fast forwarding to the present, I’m 24, worked a few jobs, met a lot of people. I decided I wanted to go back to college (ironic, I know) because I felt limited without a degree. My first semester actually went well. However, I left my job because the hours wouldn’t line up with my schooling, and I struggled to find a new one. On top of that, my best friend I’ve known for ten years seemingly abandoned me after flying out and staying at my house, and rarely talks to me. (Nothing happened between us, he just got a new girlfriend.) He went through his own mental issues and was s*icidal and I helped him, so this felt like a major betrayal. My other friends irl had a bunch of drama due to small town things and political differences, and despite me not wanting to press any of these issues I felt targeted and ostracized.

Now finally onto the Harm OCD…

I don’t quite remember what sparked the thoughts initially but I was on the home stretch of my first semester and I kept having thoughts about k*lling myself with my rifle. I had no idea why, but they gave me extreme anxiety. As much as I would try to carry on with gaming or doing my work, it kept coming back. Eventually I called my father who also struggled with anxiety and intrusive thoughts including violent ones in his youth. I explained to him the situation and eventually gave him my g*n the next day, and the thoughts went away.

A month later, the semester was over, I was feeling extreme pressure to get a job due to bills + being stuck at home, I felt isolated as I felt disenchanted from my irl friend group, and even my online friends had things going on in their lives as well. This all culminated when one night I was watching Drive on discord with a girl I was talking to and there was an extremely violent scene involving a sharp object. I’ve never enjoyed gratuitious violence in movies, and that sparked a thought in me about “what if I did that?” This thought send blood rushing to my head and I began to tense up. The girl I was talking to noticed I got silent and was acting funny, and I ended up telling a lie that I had to go. I freaked out for a bit and decided to sleep it off, yet the thoughts kept coming.

To make this long story short, it eventually latched onto my family, I cried telling my mother even though my family was understanding. Perhaps mistakenly (telltale sign of OCD) I asked them to hide all the sharp knives, which still are hidden. It hit its peak when I was walking in my local mall before work, where I had this overwhelming feeling that told me to jump off the second floor balcony. I felt my entire body feel like it was burning up and I felt I was about to collapse. My mind and body were screaming at me to do this yet my conscious was seemingly fighting it. I got on Setraline for almost two weeks now which has done okay for my depression and anxiety, yet the intrusive thoughts remain. While I’ve had moments of clarity occasionally come in where I don’t feel captive to my thoughts, they’ve been almost non-stop. Right now, I feel I have no emotion. This lack of emotion has made the thoughts scarier, as I worry I’m becoming a psychopath. I still show and express love to my family and I still do simple things for strangers such as holding the door, but I feel so disconnected. My brain wants me to believe that this is an act or I’m turning into a monster, that I feel so tormented by feelings of betrayal and rejection that this is a permanant change. As a result, I believe I’ve also wormed my way into OCD about being a psychopath where I question whether I even have empathy or have ever felt empathy. For a otherwise fairly sociable and masculine person who has cried watching ‘80s anime rom coms, the question seems ridiculous yet it feels extremely horrifying and real. This morning it began to become even more horrifying as my thoughts about psychopathy and harm combined into thinking about “what if I hurt a lot of people?” (Use your imagination.) That did give me anxiety and inspired me to write this post because I feel so afraid and alone. Even though I’m grateful for a family who is considerate and doesn’t see me as an insane person, it’s so hard to go through this. I’m still struggling with the emotions of my depression and my feelings of isolation, and my OCD has latched on to so many things and has dragged me down to Hell. I’ve been falling behind in school, I lack any drive, all I do is sit in bed and play Pokemon. My biggest interests were strategy games, military history, and international politics, yet I feel completely disinterested. On top of that I feel when I engage in my interests it actually causes anxiety, partly because I’m competitive and partly because it revolves around harm, death, and even generates animosity. I feel robbed and alone, and I’m scared. I don’t want to hurt anyone, yet I feel dead inside. As much as I’ve persevered and refused to be bedridden by this illness, it dominates my day 24/7. Sometimes the thoughts tell me that the only way to know if I’m even alive is to act. (I’ve also struggled with disassociation during this.) I’m genuinely at a loss, for years I was seen as the most mentally and physically STABLE part of my household, and frankly I was. Admittedly there were cracks beneath the surface I didn’t discuss, but I had a successful social life, jobs, and even through depression I went on. I feel like a broken man and want help. I also just want to know I’m not alone, that I’m not going insane. I read many of your guys’ post (perhaps compulsively) and yet my OCD wants me to believe I’m the exception.

END NOTE: Writing this long-form post actually reduced the anxiety (probably only temporarily unfortunately) and I’m thankful there’s a space on here to share. I know it was long-winded, but I hope none of you feel alone out there. (At this point tears are coming to my eyes) but please don’t feel you’re suffering alone, and feel free to reach out. Regardless of age, sex, or background, don’t feel like you’ll be judged or alone. You deserve to feel safe somewhere.",2025-02-14 18:14:00,Unknown,0,1ip9r2u,4,OCD,Struggling with Harm OCD/Depression (LONG POST),0.84
FalsePay5737,"I was misdiagnosed with OCD ten years ago. Learning about OCPD and resuming therapy has been extremely helpful.

My understanding is that people with OCPD perseverate and hyperfocus on issues and tasks they value (e.g. work, organizing). They have a tendency to ruminate, worry, and overthink. Their compulsions are rigid habits and routines driven by moral and ethical beliefs and a strong need for order, perfection, and control over themselves, others, and/or their environment. People may receive praise from others for behaviors stemming from OCPD (e.g. diligence at work).

The obsessions of people with OCD involve unwanted urges, images, and thoughts about danger to themselves or others that provoke anxiety. Carrying out time consuming compulsions provides temporary relief from the anxiety triggered by the obsessions. Other people, and usually the person with OCD, view the obsessions as irrational and strange. 

**EGO DYSTONIC VS. EGO SYNTONIC**

People with OCD usually view their obsessions and compulsions as separate from themselves—intrusive, distressing, and not aligned with their beliefs and desires.

People with OCPD tend to view their habits as rational, logical, justified, and as expressions of their values and beliefs. They often don’t realize that these behaviors impact them negatively (e.g. contributing to depression, work difficulties, and relationship difficulties).

This distinction is referred to as ego dystonic (for OCD) vs. ego syntonic (OCPD). There are exceptions to this pattern.

People with OCD are more likely to seek therapy to find relief from their symptoms. When people with OCPD seek therapy, it's often due to difficulties with work or relationships.

Research indicates that about 25-33% of people with OCD also have OCPD. Untreated OCPD interferes with OCD treatment.

**GENERAL DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR PERSONALITY DISORDERS** (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, DSM-5)

A. An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior the deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas:

1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people and events)
2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, liability, and appropriateness of emotional response)
3. Interpersonal functioning
4. Impulse control

C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood.

E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder.

F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma).

**OCPD DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA**

Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder \[also called Anankastic Personality Disorder\] is a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by **four (or more)** of the following:

• Is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules **to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost.**

• Shows perfectionism **that interferes with task completion** (e.g., is unable to complete a project because his or her own overly strict standards are not met).

• Is excessively devoted to work and productivity **to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships** **(not accounted for by obvious economic necessity).**

• Is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values **(not accounted for by cultural or religious identification).**

• Is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no sentimental value. \[least common symptom\]

• Is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly his or her way of doing things.

• Adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes.

• Shows rigidity and stubbornness.

**The essential feature of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts**.

Outside the U.S., mental health providers often use the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) instead of the DSM as their reference manual. The ICD refers to OCPD as Anankastic Personality Disorder.

**DIAGNOSIS**

Many people have obsessive compulsive personality characteristics. Mental health providers evaluate the extent to which they are clinically significant. The DSM notes that 2.1-7.9% of the population has OCPD. Studies suggest that about 9% of outpatient therapy clients, and 23% of inpatient clients have OCPD.

Psychiatrists and therapists with PhDs and PsyDs (psychologists) diagnose personality disorders most often. Some providers use guides for their clinical interview: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality Disorders (SCID-5-PD), The International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE), The Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP), or the Diagnostic Interview for Personality Disorders (DIPD).

Clients may complete one or a few of these assessments: Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI), Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire (PDQ), Compulsive Personality Assessment Scale (CPAS), OMNI Personality Disorder Inventory (OMNI), Wisconsin Personality Inventory (WISPI), Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP), Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology- Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ), and Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5)[.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK597372/)

Dr. Anthony Pinto created a screening survey called The Pathological Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Scale (POPS). It's available on the website of the OCPD Foundation (not allowed to include link). He suggests that people show concerning results to a mental health provider and that they retake the POPS to monitor their progress in treatment.

**CO-MORBIDITY**

People with OCPD often have co-morbid conditions. Depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD, ASD, OCD, and other personality disorders are most common. Dr. Megan Neff, a psychologist who has autism and ADHD, has a website called Neurodivergent Insights. The misdiagnosis section is very popular; it has Venn diagrams showing the similarities and differences between many disorders, including OCD and OCPD. Dr. Neff has a podcast called ""Divergent Conversations.""

**PODCAST**

**""The Healthy Compulsive Project Podcast""** is available on Apple, Stitcher, Spotify Podcasts, and Amazon Audible. It’s an excellent resource for people who struggle with perfectionism, rigidity, and/or strong need for control, regardless of whether they meet the diagnostic criteria for OCPD.

Episodes 5 and 12 focus on OCD and OCPD.

**BOOKS**

**Too Perfect:** **When Being in Control Gets Out of Control** (1996, 2nd ed.): Dr. Allan Mallinger shares his theories about OCPD, based on his work as a psychiatrist specializing in OCPD. The Spanish edition is La Obsesión Del Perfeccionismo (2010). You can listen to Too Perfect by signing up for a free trial of Amazon Audible. YouTube has a 45 minute sample of the audio book.

Dr. Mallinger states that the ""the obsessive personality style \[as\] a system of many normal traits, all aiming toward a common goal: safety and security via alertness, reason, and mastery. In rational and flexible doses, obsessive traits usually labor not only survival, but success and admiration as well. The downside is that you can have too much of a good thing. You are bound for serious difficulties if your obsessive qualities serve not the simple goals of wise, competent, and enjoyable living, but an unrelenting need for fail-safe protection against the vulnerability inherent in being human. In this case, virtues become liabilities.”

**The Healthy Compulsive: Healing Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder and Taking the Wheel of the Driven Personality** (2020): Gary Trosclair shares his theories about OCPD, based on his work as a therapist with 30+ years of experience. He specializes in OCPD. This book has helped many people with OCPD improve their self-awareness, coping skills, relationships, productivity, and hope for the future. Trosclair describes his book as a “comprehensive approach to using the potentially healthy aspects of the compulsive personality in a constructive way.”

**I’m Working On It In Therapy: How To Get The Most Out of Psychotherapy** (2015): Gary Trosclair offers advice about strategies for actively participating in individual therapy, building relationships with therapists, and making progress on mental health goals.

**Please Understand Me** (1998, 2^(nd) ed.): Psychologist David Keirsey presents theories about how personality types impact beliefs and values, and influence one’s behavior as a friend, romantic partner, parent, student, teacher, employee, and employer.

Some people with OCPD struggle with work addiction and procrastination.

**Chained to the Desk: A Guidebook for Workaholics, Their Partners and Children, and the Clinicians who Treat Them** (2014, 3rd ed.): Bryan Robinson, a recovering workaholic and therapist, offers theories about the causes of work addiction and advice about work-life balance.

5150Panda,"I think the worst I had was when  I called home after I finally got myself admitted with intentions of seeking the help I needed rather than serving out 72 hour tdo etc and finessing my way out the door as quickly as I could manipulate the docs to pop the locks and let me out after the timer expired.  I was brought up taught that mental health issues were a weakness and a mark of shame and a huge flaw.  It would be something people used to exploit me or box me in and file me away or use as an excuse to mistreat me etc.  As a really young kid I was severely abused neglected molested degraded drugged and encouraged into delinquency in all sense of the words.  I even had an attempt made on my life made by my own mother at the age of 4.  She caught me acting out sexually and in stead of trying to figure out how I even knew how to go about the shit I was doing with another child my age she instead wigged out.  She dragged me in the living room and more or less tossed my small body onto the sofa.  Ended up pinning me into the corner of it.  I remember her more or less behaving like a raving fucking lunatic herself.  Rage attack.  She ultimately took one of the sofa pillows and placed it over my face and I remember everything went dark.  Now I know I was young but for the most part while it's not perfect I have a near total ability to recall the visuals of memory content with photographic clarity.  I don't hold that for words.  I also remember smells that way too.  Well when things went dark my cinematic recall has a black hole that has what seems to be several days worth of time lapsed in which the next recollection I have was waking up in my bedroom early hours of the morning.  I don't have my recall tied to time.  I don't recall specific dates or times that even significant events occured... even recent shit.  Trying to remember what year this or that happened ends up frustrating me immensely and forcing an answer out of me seeking ""to the best I can recall"" will end up resulting in what is more than likely a wrong answer and if you're the type to go back and try to validate these dates and come back and try to accuse me of bullshitting when your date search came back something different is totally a dick move.  

Regardless I acted out a lot all over and schools etc insisted more or less I see someone.  I didn't trust adults.  Most doctors I got dragged to spent most of the appointment speaking to my mom.  Perhaps dad if he was sober or even home to come.  They were fuckin nervous it seemed I would end up revealing their dirty secrets to these shrinks.  They'd have me in the other room to start but they'd eventually move be to the play rug behind mom/dad before they left the room  and allowed me to begin free play with toys.  Very shortly there after the doc was moved to have my folks exit and would ask me to come sit in a chair if I wanted.  I'd ignore him.  Every one of them.  Every attempt they made to probe at me I more or less acted like they didn't exist I just kept playing.  Any attempts to ask anything particularly uncomfortable only provoked Mtmy play to become physically aggressive and violent.  They didn't know i was being instructed over and over all week and the whole way there I didn't have tell the doc anything I didn't feel like talking about and he can't make me tell him secrets .... obviously looking back thus was them hoping beyond hope they would not get exposed.  My refusal to comply lead me to a lot of different docs and therapist and even neurologist and such.  All kinds of drugs tried.  Diagnosis of conduct disorders.  I can't recall all of the various meds I got placed on and force fed at home.   The biggest impact I got from one came in form of side effects and that came in 4th grade when they stuck my little ass on a big dose of fucking Haldol.  I ended up not being able to stay awake in school and NY straight a grades from the very start sagged to Cs and Ds.  I literally could not stay awake.  I ended up developing an array of nervous tics that ended up moving my treatment exclusively to a neurologist who eagerly diagnosed me with tourettes.  Obviously I wasn't slumped hard enough on the Haldol alone and this dickhead added clonidine to my med regimine to treat the tourettes stating it can make people sleepy but I'd adjust.  I fell out so hard in class I was having moments of apnea and I was literally pissing myself.  Remove one of these?  Nope!  Add imipramine to treat the involuntary urination.  Eventually he caught a clue and I got moved over to some nasty black label listed med called pimozide.  They added a script for Ritalin to me not so much for add or adhd but in hopes it would functionally wake me up.i did wake up but I was hella zombified and the Ritalin ended up exacerbating the hell out of the nervous tics.  This fuckery kept up until I made it to 9th grade.i had gone.from am academic whiz kid to a flunkie barely scraping by to the next grade having to attend summer school more than once to keep from being held back.  I knew high-school GPA was important so I asserted myself.  I was tired of them having the raw audacity getting angry and insulting over my poor grades insisting I am capable of better I showed that before and now it's like all I am is a complete fuckup and that I should be ashamed of myself for settling for this level of performance.  Told them I wasn't taking another fucking pill or visiting another head doc and if they tried to make me i would ensure they regretted it.  I made them a solemn promise to stay the fuck out of trouble and stop fighting in school.  And just because I'm fucking weird doesn't mean I have to actually act out every fucked up thought I had so I promised them I'd can that too...

Move forward what seemed an eternity I decided to self admit and submit to whatever they decided was required. I cut the bullshit lies hiding manipulation and perhaps the biggest thing I elected to do was willfully shed the shame I felt from my families lessons regarding opening up and talking about the total magnitude and range of the array of symptom clusters I experienced and lived with.  Dealing with trouble up to and including incarnations along with many failed relationships and ruined credit and burned bridges and destroyed career paths etc.  Each time I got blindsided with a tdo I just ate the blame.  Let then drive the narrative of why and basically express remorse as best I could fake something I didn't even understand  shit there were worlds worth of experiences in later years I couldn't even verify the veracity of at all.  I didn't know much of what was really real or what my mind had tricked me with.  After my intake and evals and Diagnostic phase... I called home.  It was something I ended up regretting by the time the call was over.  My mom and younger brother were at her house.  They conferenced my dad into the call.  He was of course drunk and really didn't offer much beyond frequent belches sighs of exasperation and intermittent repeated the phrase I fucking told you about this shit you moron.  You're no son of MINE.  I more or less explained the shit that had happened thus far and they rushed into asking me what they had told me was wrong with me.  Like I figured all that they cared about was what specific type of mentally fucked up I was.  That's why I bothered even calling I figured I would deliver the courtesy of answering the age old question of ""What the fuck is wrong with Ronnie?""  I had multiple comorbidities bit the only 2 they latched on to were the 2 of schizophrenia and aspd with extensive primary and secondary characteristics of phsycopathy present.  That's all that mattered.  They heard the psychopath schizo combo and my mom gasped like in shock and said oh my God Ronnie...you really ARE a monster...the line went silent.  Dad said.  No som of mine... and my brother came on the line as my father finally found the right button to actually disconnect the call.  My brother got like... accusatory and very condescending in his tone like all the sudden his simple minded border line retarded ass was superior to me was flat out ""RONNIE!!!...You KNOW ..WE did NOT ask for this!"" It took me a moment to process through the medication fog to process the fact the little insipid prick bastard had the incredibly hateful and disrespectful position that somehow this mental pain and anguish I MYSELF have to suffer all my fucking life... was somehow not at all a concern with how it effected me.... all that matters was how it was somehow in his mind somehow a burden they feel like I've wronged them by forcing THEM to bear it somehow.. like I should be ashamed for doing this to them somehow.  I went on a long and extremely hateful loud and yet somehow thru the meds and rage still eloquent and elegantly delivered for maximum emotional damage infliction for how his stance was absolutely so self centered and inconsiderate that he may want to go and consider contemplating suicide with serious reasons that he should even himself not be so fucking remedial that he couldn't see if that he needed to give meticulous methodically and sincere consideration to opting to going ahead and using one of his guns to go ahead and vent that useless fucking brain inside his skull.  I suggested his 12 gage with 000 magnum rounds to ensure maximum velocity of force and removal of the choke to allow the spread pattern to open wider since 000 had fewer pellets and he didn't wanna fuck around and live by somehow missing that useless peanut tucked down in that dense void of absolute shit behind his eyes.  He needed to ensure the force at the focal point of impact was at maximum velocity so just that alone would ensure a delightfully messy amount of damage.  And when it was all said and done the world would be a better place because thoughts like the one he for whatever was not ashamed to admitting he even had in there would all be left behind him.  Quite literally.  Told him to do it at mom's.  That way there was someone who needed to see what that mindset deserved and of course someone there to clean up the last funfetti mess he would ever make.  He stayed of the phone.  I don't think he understood a lot of it .  He really is fucking low iq and I used a lot of ""big ol fancy words like I do to make him feel stupid""... but he did grasp I was instructing him to blow his fucking own head off at mom's home so she could clean it up and I think I heard him sob.mom grabbed the phone from him and told me very sharply that I really am a monster and this is just more proof.  She told me that I am NOT going to be allowed to go around stomping on everyone else's feelings just because i don't have any of my own.  Called me a piece of shit and started in on something else and I screamed off into the ward trying to get her attention more than folks there to make a threat her way.  I hollered very loudly.  Someone come deal with this piece of trash excuse of a human.  I hollered very clearly I'm here by my own choice and can leave by the same.... come put her in her place please before I choose to self discharge and go and stick her ass in the fucking dirt with the worms.  She claims to be jesus' where but I reckon I put her ass deep in the dark in a box with them nails off in the woods all alone it ain't to the pearly gates she will go.  If cerebus does chew her ass up after crossing Styx satan will certainly have fun fucking her over for all eternity just as she did my entire life.....hellbound bitch give lucifer my good tidings and dap belial up.  You've showed me your demons you silly bitch and they merely made me stronger.  here now behold as I cut away my own skins and roll back my own disguise and reveal to you the TRUE nature of MY dark soul. . ..  the staff had me at this point.  Comfy cloths butt drugs and a little room all to myself ended up turning that voluntary admission and ability to leave of my own free will into a thing of the past.  Rofl but it was worth it .... I did end up seeing her in person once more later.. and my father once more as well.  I haven't spoken to either of them at this point in over a decade likely closer to 15 years.  But last time I saw my old man I ended up in a brawl with him.  He was drunk and even in his aged state he was still hateful and very overly confident in his prowess as a badass. 

One thing I didn't mention was the translation of my frequent violent behavior and fighting from middle school that I had to end in high-school into an outlet it was otherwise allowed and managed to get myself attached to a older chinese fellow that was a friend of my family (mom's side but not my mother specifically) who had been over here for a long while but had spent his life a practitioner of kung fu and between school and trying to work to make some of my own money I spent the rest of my time with Le Sifu and was taken initially on a teacher disciple 1:1 basis.  I was extremely honored and diligent and gave my fullest devotion to this practice and I ended up forgoing typical teenage shenanigans of chasing girls and such trying to get laid and all that into learning all I could from this small and slight old man who demonstrated numerous times that his slight presence was his greatest asset because he was oft immediately underestimated.  He was a fuckin amazing practitioner.   I miss him tremendously.   One human being that I actually respected and honored rather than opted to go all out psycho and charm beguile manipulate and take them for all I could before they had enough and ran for the hills. I saw people in general as simply things there for me to use....

Anyways... I've carried on enough.  I just wanted to open up and share some of MY personal struggle obviously this was just a peek into the cliff notes whereas the full story is more like an oldschool unrated grindhouse cinema flick that left you feeling somehow personally accostedand somehow uncomfortable having viewed it lol... main stream horror ain't got shit on me.  Perhaps here I'm just making light of my own shit but I went thru hell and i was forged in its darkest depths and tempered in its hottest flames... I was handmade with the finest of dark lucifarian alchemical practices and I'm presently on a personal quest that I've taken up the mantle to carry out until the end of time and back... I am seeking the big ass red button out there in the universe and all its dimensions and multiverse variable function calls to the point of infinite.  I don't care if I search and never find it. I'll eventually get far enough out there to transcend time and once there I'll ask the atman, the universal one, for directions... cus when I do find it.. . . I practice that grin and laugh daily for belting forth as I mash that bitch in as I mock the do not push in big bold letters.  System reboot time if that day ever gets here.  Fuck your simulation instancing and holographic universe.   I'll head on back to hell then I guess.

Sleepypanboy,"I have recently been thinking about my marijuana use (legal country) and how it affects my symptoms, and that has got me wondering about how weed interacts with a variety of people on the schizophrenia spectrum, and if they have noticed any repeating patterns in regards to hallucinations or negative symptoms. 

I would like to specify I am aware that marijuana affects everyone differently, and considering schizophrenia is different for everyone as well, there is no certain or specific answer for how it will affect everyone. I am just wondering about trends people have personally noticed in themselves and to discuss the positive or negative trends in individuals. I am also aware marijuana can trigger psychosis in some people. 

Personally I have noticed a variety of symptoms from my weed use on my general mental health symptoms such as:

-increased brain fog 
-increased dissociation and ‘dream like’ feelings
-increased visual hallucinations especially of people and animals 
-my long term tolerance for anxiety has been lowered 

I have also noticed 

-the voices are much less loud and constant, and my suicidal ideation goes down significantly because of this (I am receiving help for suicidal ideation)
-hallucinations cause less anxiety and are easier to cope with and move on from 
-slowed thinking with less overlapping sounds and voices 
-I have an easier time expressing myself and feel much less ‘flat’

So far the harm reduction aspect of marijuana use has outweighed the negative, but it is something to still monitor and just because it has helped some of my own symptoms I do not recommend it for anyone else, especially with underlying psychotic symptoms. 

I would like to add I am working with medical professionals to manage my symptoms and have tried a variety of medications and therapies, but so far self medication has been the most helpful. I continue to monitor my substance use and keep my mental health team updated. 

Thanks for reading, and please remove this if it violates any rules. ",2024-10-21 05:01:50,Unknown,50,1g8c6un,11,schizophrenia,How has marijuana affected your symptoms? ,1.0
cagrits,"1st time reddit poster. I hope I'm asking this in the right place. I'm not even sure how to start this.

My husband has a son (28) who we believe was diagnosed as schizophrenic about 8 years ago. I say believe because this all happened after he turned 18 and having any kind of open discussion with his Dr's has been hard due to privacy issues. We are under the impression it was drug induced through stress/heavy marijuana use starting in his teens.

Some background, Even as a young child he always had physical ""ticks"" and I'm pretty positive he's on the spectrum, but he was never diagnosed. His parents we're divorcing around the time, we think, his 1st symptoms started to appear and we believe he turned to weed to cope with the stress and developing symptoms. Sadly, everything was hidden or missed until after he became an adult

 He came to live with us after turning 18 with the agreement that he stay off weed and seek help. It was very obvious that weed was making him respond to internal stimuli ( I hope this is the right word for the voices) and we were at a loss for how else to help. We contacted county mental health services and sadly got nowhere because he was an adult and needed to get the help himself. He would never follow through. 

After many failed attempts to stay clean and the arguments that followed, he left and went to live with his mom. She sadly didn't encourage him to get help. They refused any contact from us after this. 

 We got a desperate call from his mom about a year later that he was going to hurt himself and to come get him. We rushed to him and got him to a hospital. We were finally able to have him committed for a psych hold and after, we got him into an amazing residential program that worked with young adults with mental illnesses and drug addiction issues. This is where we 1st heard the term drug induced schizophrenia.

It was an 18 month program. He was doing great and he seemed to be flourishing. When he was about 8 months in, weed was legalized where we live. He quickly decided he was ""cured"" and convinced his mom to come pick him up, after we refused. This did not go well. He spiraled and she kicked him out shortly after. He has been homeless with small bouts of jail time/mental health stays for about the last 6 years.

We always made it clear that if he was willing to stay clean & stay on his meds he could come live with us.

He called Sunday, sounding pretty good, saying he was ready to get off the streets and stay clean. We drove to get him. Talked to a case worker, through him, that said his case could be transfered to where we live but he would have to initiate it. We got no other information from the case worker regarding him. We were supposed to get a followup call but it went to voice mail and we haven't yet gotten personally in touch.

So here we are. We picked him up on Monday. I know this is a really stressful time for him. He's got to be filled with anxiety quitting weed and going from homeless to living in a house with 3 other people who are practically strangers to him (my daughter, 20, lives with us too). Hell he's practically a stranger to us. 

He has a room to himself. We bought him headphones because he said they helped. He seems to be sleeping a lot, which I expected. He says he's taking his meds every night, but he's responding to a lot of internal stimuli, sometimes there's arguments or loud conversations with the voices. Is this typical behavior from a person on medication?

 He seems really animated and excited when talking to the voices but when he interacts with us, he's almost sullen and he seems to be telling us what we want to hear. Is this normal? 

Do we ignore or acknowledge him talking to the voices? Can we set limits on how he's responding to the voices (like no yelling) Should he be able to follow these limits?

Although he's really intelligent, between stopping to play with all toys in the store and all of the fantasy talk about undiscovered gems he's going to turn into a weapon for Google and finding billions of dollars of cubic zirconia that he's sadly misplaced, it feels like he is mentally stuck at age 14. Is this due to the drug use or is there maybe something more here? 

  We don't know what to expect out of him or how to support him moving forward. He's obviously not stable which I also expected but do we just go with the flow for a bit to let things settle?

He has yet to contact the county to continue his mental health treatment. How long should we give him to settle into being here before pushing this? He's a grown man, we can't do this for him but he's obviously stuck in a somewhat child like state too. We really want to help him succeed in life but we're so lost.

What else can we do?  What should we expect? We have no one to talk to about this. We live pretty rural and there's no support groups or anything I can find. He's lonely too and wanting to find friends. How do we support him in this? 

I hope I'm not being offensive with my wording or anything I'm asking. We're all really overwhelmed here and just want to understand this. Thank you for any advice or insight you can offer.

NOT DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AS OF POSTING


Hello everyone, about two weeks ago, after two sessions with my psychiatrist, spaced a month and a half apart, I (20M) was officially diagnosed with BPD and psychosis. Initially, she diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder and OCD. This is the third psychiatrist I've seen, following two others who diagnosed me with general anxiety/depression. For the past two years, I've been struggling intensely with anxiety, which peaked around four months ago when I quit marijuana. During this time, I found it incredibly difficult to get out of bed and frequently experienced panic attacks.


I've since realized that what I thought were panic attacks were actually psychotic episodes. During these episodes, I experienced auditory hallucinations—initially hearing my name, but it has since escalated to abusive language—intense paranoia, and a feeling of being outside my own body. My hallucinations have worsened with my new medication, and my next appointment is in a month. My psychiatrist believes that my drug use and genetic predisposition (both my uncle and grandfather had severe schizophrenia) likely contributed to the development of my psychosis.


I've also been undergoing therapy, but it's primarily for generalized anxiety, which I struggle with less due to the medication. Unfortunately, there are no therapists in my area who practice DBT or any form of therapy that can specifically help with my condition.


Every day is a struggle. While I try my best to work and sometimes manage to go to the gym, most days I'm stuck in my room, unable to do anything. The co-morbidity of BPD and psychosis makes everything worse, and I become intensely emotionally dysregulated over things that aren't even real. I've resorted to self-harm to silence the voices and constantly feel paranoid that someone's watching me in my room. Every couple of days, I experience intense episodes where I lock myself in my room because I'm genuinely scared I might hurt my family. During these episodes, I become delirious and talk back to the voices, and cry uncontrollably.


I'm posting here to see if anyone else struggles with BPD and psychosis and what methods you use to cope, or at least have ways to feel less helpless and alone during episodes.",2025-02-14 20:56:53,Unknown,13,1ipd1o4,1,schizophrenia,BPD & (Possible) Schizophrenia,0.66
mykaykat,"Okay so, hey there pretty new to the sub. Two months ago my nurse psyche practitioner said he wasn’t equipped to handle my condition (schizoaffective depressive type, ASD, CPTSD and probably an eating disorder I haven’t talked about or wanted to acknowledge but unsure) and since my physical health caused me to stop taking seraquel (I used to take 300mg for about 2years, worked fine but my liver and kidneys started deteriorating for an unknown reason, I’m getting a liver biopsy to find out) and since the other meds he had me on wouldn’t work I just stopped taking them so he referred me to outpatient. I’ve been going now probably a month every day of the week except for weekends (started early last month) and honestly it feels like I’m getting worse.

I’ve been given new meds and at first I was hopeful, but I just….don’t care anymore? My SI is still every 20 minutes, it’s all I can focus on and if not that then I think about just wasting away. I stopped taking my meds two weeks ago because I’d already been off the month prior for nearly a year so I figured screw it, this is my life now lol.

I just don’t care for me anymore. I don’t wish to eat and I’ve lost 20lbs since I’ve began outpatient unintentionally. I’ve stopped taking all meds not just psyche ones because I just think “what’s the point?” I guess it doesn’t help having what I’m guessing is a delusion that if I hurt myself I’ll get good luck and fortune, even though so far it’s turned out true so I’m unsure if it’s a delusion or if I can see the different timelines that contain good and bad outcomes. (Hurt yourself and you’ll be rewarded for doing the universe’s job kind of thing, y’know?)

I’m reminded constantly at outpatient that “you are the only one who can fix you” and “it’ll only work if you put the time in and want it to work.” It’s like whatever the hell is lingering in me subconsciously is beyond spiteful. I know there’s another me inside me, I’ve heard them on the operating table after I woke up at the end of a surgery  I had which caused me to go into inpatient (I fully believe in the split conscious theory after that experience, my hallucinations also started getting extremely bad and frequent after that). It feels like I’ve gotten worse because now I see the abuse I’ve been through and am in constant turmoil without any coping methods helping by any means. They keep saying it gets worse before it gets better, but as someone who’s just experienced decline after decline, I don’t think they know what they’re talking about. It doesn’t help that outpatient is severely overcrowded and only allowed 2 groups, so literally you have mood disorders with schizophrenics, ptsd survivors with anger issues and substance issues, as well as autistic and adhd- I’ve been told that’s not how outpatient is usually run but they’re underfunded. You’re allowed to see the therapist once a month for one on one’s and the psychiatrist once a month. If you want to talk during group well good luck, there’s always a handful of people who never shut the fuck up whether it be on topic or not (mostly not, and again they drone on and on). I already hate humans enough, so having to sit there with a smile on my face pretending I don’t want to bash my head into the glass windows is a battle of wills I don’t think I’m going to win on holding out on.  
Not to mention the place is overly religious, and as someone with severe religious trauma it seems tone deaf to have nurse’s giving sermon’s under the guise of emotional education every Thursday (and I mean literal sermons, quoting scripture and everything. I’ve called and complained, don’t because you’ll be treated like a demonic pest when you show up the group and WILL be ignored by said nurse!)

They’ve suggested inpatient twice at outpatient, twice I’ve vehemently rejected because I remember my experience and the hopeless feeling of being strapped to a bed. The sad part is? I’ve heard the other outpatient program is worse and is actually where one of the attending therapists worked before transitioning to the outpatient I’m currently in. My state also doesn’t offer PHP, just inpatient and outpatient.

I guess I’m just asking for direction….i don’t know what to do and everyday I feel both stuck and spiraling. I just want to quit going so I can wither away. I don’t want to leave my parents because I’m literally only living for them, but once they’re gone I plan on ending it all. Life just.…I don’t know, I just don’t see people’s purpose or my own.

D1_Constantine,"So it all started with a drug-induced psychosis around 3 years ago, recently I leveled up to a Schizo-affective disorder. Always took my meds & stuff. From my observation I had minor symptoms since a teenager or so. I often want to die, not exactly suicide because of believes but even so I want to be dead than alive, needless to say I have quite depressive episodes that last for weeks.

Now I have to make something certain, I do appreciate that I got sick in the first place. I view it as an overall benefit for a couple of reasons. One of them is that it leaned my way of thinking in the right direction, like learning a hard lesson. I have exact aims of what I want to do with my life and they are not orthodox, but will make me happy or rather they will make my life more fun (I do not view happiness as essential for our purpose \*if we have one in the first place). My main problem is that I feel super stuck and it's not just a feeling, self-isolating haven't helped me much with screen addiction, but at the same time I cannot replace it because the moment I start thinking it's an endless loop of obsessive & intruding thoughts. I also can't handle emotions very well, specially strong ones like love. I feel going down a spiral and I'm not sure how to recover. In the end I fear I'll waste the possibility of having fun with the world by accepting defeat. I would ask if you have any cool tips to help me out but I'm not sure I want that, rather I would like to hear how are you doing ?",2025-02-02 10:45:58,Unknown,13,1ifpzz7,2,schizophrenia,"Hi, been sick for 3 years.

Ok_Seaworthiness_511,"I just want to see if anyone has had a similar experience. 

So everything started about 2019 i was very depressed. I basically stopped drinking tap water bc i thought the gov controlled us through it. I wasn't hearing voices telling me anything but it was like this inner knowing from a higher power. I thought i could receive messages and read peoples minds. But if the gov found out about these powers they would kill me. That led to me becoming so depressed i ended up being hospitalized because i got very suicidal at that point. I didnt tell anyone what was really going on (due to fear of the gov finding out) i just made it clear i was depressed. I lost about 80lbs in that year. I would have a lot of delusions revolving around the government. 

Fast forward i have crippling anxiety 2023 still having delusions. But i started having hallucinations every other month and i just talked it up to anxiety or maybe i didnt sleep enough. But fast forward again to about august of last year i had some kind of mental issue idk how to word it. I was at work and had been struggling every day for 2 weeks straight with dissasociation BAD. It would happen out of nowhere i would forget where i was what i was doing my long term memory was there but my short term memory was absolutely non existent. The last day i worked there i was pacing back and fourth forgetting what i was doing there were complete blank gaps in my memory (about 5 min incriments) they ended up calling a ambulance on me and they thought i was on drugs. I ended up quitting and havent been able to work since then. 

Now fast forward to now and starting 3 months ago ive been having hallucinations every single day. My dr and neurologist say its probably the beginning stages of schizoaffective disorder . Im a 24 yr f and apparently this is when it usually starts showing.  Schizophrenia runs in my family and i always known that it's a possibility. But i just dont know if this is similar to anyone else's experience. I go to a psychiatrist soon so we will see what they say but i just dont understand how I suddenly one day start hallucinating like crazy. My nurse practitioner was stuck on possibility of me having major depression with psychosis but i have BPD and when im depressed or manic I KNOW and i do not feel depressed in the slightest i feel pretty normal for whats going on. I guess im just confused and would like some help to see if anyone had any ideas on what the hell is going on with me. Because I really do get frustrated with the fact that i have 0 control over this like anxiety, depression,and mania i know somewhat to a degree how to control it. But hallucinations i have no fking clue because they start out of nowhere like they have no cause im not feeling stressed when it starts im not feeling sad im just feeling normal then bam someone is calling my name that isnt real... and i just start seeing shadows and flashing lights throughout the day that i have no control over. And the more i hallucinate the more likely i am to go into a state of extreme disassociation to the point im just like not even a living person im just there in my shell letting my body do what it needs to survive and get through the day. Im just sick of feeling so out of it and like something is wrong with me and not knowing what it is. 

Have you or anyone else you know had similar experiences and ended up being diagnosed with a schizo type of disorder?

Admirable-Function64,"Hi my name is Holly 26F and I’m having a hard time in my schizophrenia/treatment journey. This may get long but I really need support so I appreciate anyone that wants to help but please be nice im genuinely in a very fragile state of mind. I was 12 when I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia including a lot of traumatic psychosis several years beforehand. I guess technically depending on who you ask I could be considered early onset, yet I don’t recall much of my teen years nor my early adulthood because getting my diagnosis at 12 meant being approved for the “all mighty clozapine” and if you’ve been on that you may understand why I put it in quotation marks. The only thing I recall about being put on clozapine was being told at 12 I could pluck that hail bail from it(but it was apparently the only thing that would save me) I was put in the psych ward fully aware at 12 years old this could pluck me because I was being taken off meds for the first time since and this new so called miracle(literally what my mom called this damn drug) could ruin some white part of my blood that I couldn’t comprehend at the tender age of 12. My memories say I was put on meds around 5 or 6 cause my parents smashed it into my favorite juice and ruined that juice forever(I will never forget the flavor bro😭). I was on clozapine non stop till age 24(if I did the math right that’s 12 years) lol I have the blood draw scars and the permanent cognitive damage to prove it. Sadly, it all caught up to me and to prove a point when I stopped it, I did it cold turkey and I didn’t tell anybody for 6 months and I shouldn’t have done that but I did and I’m still here after round two with the clozapine super pluck risk. One day it hit kinda  me like a box of rocks that I was just sedated for so long and I’m still struggling with that right now…it’s only been two years since I’ve been off of clozapine. Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn’t have stopped it but then I remember my brain was addicted to the sedation, cause it made everything easier to block out so I could fully disassociate and I could forget my world ya know?(I was an AVID reader lol talk about another addictive deflection method dang) anyways lol I was back on track for a bit and I had been back on treatment and it started olanzapine, +2 separate anxiety/depression, meds. Although I realized that that was it was slowing me down, it’s not that I have beef with the medication cause I need it and I also know that schizophrenia is just not researched enough. I sometimes I feel like there has to be a better way than Literally inducing cognitive harm to combat and illness that also causes cognitive harm. I don’t know I guess it kinda baffles me but I’m also no neuroscientist or anything like that so who knows, I give everything a shot I’m a desperate girl just looking for aid in my head. I didn’t stop the olanzapine on purpose. It’s not something I wanted to do cause although I do not like antipsychotics affects I do feel like I also might be addicted to the sedation that they give, that does kind of rub me a little bit wrong because addiction runs in my bloodline as well as the mental illness. Please don’t mistake me I’m not one to just stop meds for no reason that’s simply not me at so this time it came down to transportation issues while I went out into the world, trying to be a big girl ,but it just led to me being stuck again. I wanna get back on that that train of treatment but I’m having this massive block and I went in and I got the orientation finished but something clicked and I got scared and now I started this new job and it’s something I’ve never done and it takes a lot of cognitive function and I’m really spiraling with little to no support and it’s making me feel like I’m about a dead end, I think I might be having delusions but then again I’m just a very logical person and I see things from a bigger perspective so I honestly I don’t know I genuinely feel like I just need encouragement right now. Someone to give me up on my feet and tell me to get my life together because I don’t necessarily have it, especially from somebody that might understand the schizo life a bit more than the people that I feel are unintentionally sabotaging me in my life right now simply due to misunderstanding my episodes past/current cause I know I’ve put them through the ringer and I don’t ever make much sense to them.",2025-04-03 13:22:28,Unknown,1,1jqcimy,1,schizophrenia,Mental blocks are draining me,0.67
carlhenry_741,"TO THOSE WHO CARE FOR THEIR LIVES, PLEASE READ!!!! I LITERALLY RECOVERED FROM THIS A FEW YEARS AGO AFTER A 6 YEAR HIATUS. I TRIED TO MAKE IT SHORT BUT MADE AN EFFORT TO RELATE AND HELP OTHERS DEALING WITH THIS.... ITS WORTH IT.

A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia while I was in college. I met a weird ass girl who claimed she was psychic. She literally looked like something out of movie because she was short and had serious issues with her lower body causing her to have to use a cane when she walked... Anyways I just moved in and met a lot of new people. she hung out with our group because she lived on the same floor. The first day most of our floor hung out in a guys room(probably 10 of us) and started drinking. We're all just hanging out. I happened to be sitting next to her and all of a sudden she randomly starts talking about weird shit like she can guess what color hair my mom had and claimed she was psychic but when she got a question wrong she would talk her way out of it. Everyone in the room except her were completely silent the entire time she was yapping her brains out.........lol? the only reason I was nice to her was because I just met everyone and I didn't want to come off as an asshole........ so I befriended her...... Man, was I in for one HELL of a surprise 🤦

Fast forward a couple weeks go by and she keeps approaching me in the cafe and kept talking about supernatural visions she was having and insisting that I make an effort to develop the skill that she apparently had.. now I wasn't the type of person to attempt to think that stuff through.. Id normally be like oh hell nah your crazyyyyy AF!!!??!? I'm not gonna take a step in that direction(more to follow on why I believe God told Adam and Eve to not eat from the tree of ""knowledge""). But I couldn't help but think about what that girl was talking about. I started believing that I could predict Powerball numbers and cheat on tests etc.(none of that actually came to fruition)

Fast forward a year and now I'm thinking I can read what's going on around me. I'm thinking that I'm starting to develop the skill and sooner or later........... I'll be a FREAKIN GENIUS....................
Then it hit me like a brick wall(and I mean that in every sense of the term)......... I was sitting in class and all of a sudden I swore my professor was talking about me. He kept looking at me and it was like he was talking to me indirectly and too the rest of the class. Almost like he was trying to expose me in some way. Now everyone who spoke sounded like they were frustrated with why I was getting all the attention....... This continued for both junior and senior year and everywhere I went. It was like everyone knew everything about me and constantly made an effort to expose me. It was so real that my friends and family did not sound that way but seemed like they were trying to signal to me that ""oh I already know this.. you just woke up huh??""........ Literally like a switch turned on an everyone was woke.

It was ABSOLUTELY the most TERRIFYING experience I've ever had. Me being the purpose driven, reasonably responsible person, I almost had to freakin drop out of school to seek medical help but I refused because I got sooooooo mentality ill to the point that I thought the doctor would think ....oh he just ""woke up"" he's not fully developed yet.....Crazy right???????.... I can't even get myself to go seek help. Like a parasite was controlling my brain....

Now, I managed to pass all my classes and graduate but remained unemployed because I kept telling the employer during interviews about my condition... Obviously you should never bring that type of thing up in an interview if you expect to be an ideal candidate or they will think you're crazy and unstable..... So while I was unemployed I started drinking because my dad who lived at home at the time would always drink. I never had a problem with it in the past so he would offer me liquor everyday thinking I was soon going to land a job... Years have gone by an now I'm a full blown alcoholic.......I became completely antisocial. Stopped going out and continued to refuse medical help. My parents called the police and they showed up to my house probably 3-4 different times to send me to the hospital, where I would continue to deny that I was mentally ill...

A few more years go by and my mom ends up getting admitted to the hospital for kidney stones and blood infection. My family was so distraught that my sister called the police on me AGAIN and they showed up for a warrant that was issued to me and brought me to the court house for a trial on my alcohol abuse case........... Fast forward,,,now I'm in rehab..............1 month goes by and am around some hardcore drug addicts... Fuckin' screaming in the hallway in the middle of the night. Arguing over cigarettes..fights, you name it. Exactly what you would expect rehab to be like. 2 months in, I keep to my self, minding my own business and now I'm starting to think the other drug addicts around me are plotting to fight me. They would pick on me for being so quiet. So........., I FINALLYYYYYY give in.... I request to speak to a doctor in the hopes that they would send me home(which they did not lol). I finally tell the doctor everything............ He said that I had some how developed a form of schizophrenia and he prescribed me the psych medication RESPIRADONE... I would see him weekly and I kept telling him that my condition is persistent(which it was)and he kept upping the dosage(probably 2-3 more times)........ THAT STUFF HAD TO HAVE SAVED MY LIFE!!!!

Fast forward.... It's my last day and I'm waiting on my ride home not thinking anything of it... My ride finally arrives and it's a 2 hour drive home.................it wasnt until I got home that I realized that I had FULLY cured from my full blown schizophrenic experience. I did not for one second on the ride home think the driver was reading my mind or tauting me in some way. We did have some short convs but it was like talking to God. First time in years I spoke to someone where they sounded like they had no idea what was going on in my head......That last month at rehab, now that I think about it, was actually way better than I had thought. I literally stopped thinking that people were watching me and I truly believe the medication along with forcing my self into social environments helped with my full recovery.

One thing I forgot to mention was that while I was in that mess I was reading the Bible and learning about God and the devil. Everyone knows the story of Adam and Eve and how God said to them, you can eat whatever you want but DO NOT eat from THAT tree(the tree of knowledge). Apparently people who are psychic actually worship Satan and are leveraging the idea that they can attain this ancient knowledge for their own benefits... God mentioned in the Bible that this knowledge is not for humans and that it will only bring you misery because he did not design the world and humans to function in that spiritual domain....Satan thought otherwise.......Just something to think about...as the old saying goes, ""Curiosity killed the cat"".

Never attempt to enter territory which you are not familiar without approval from God and proper guidance. It's common sense to understand that in the physical world, there are places which most people do not belong. People go to third world, run down countries where they are cutting people's heads off and sending them to family members for fun(Hell). It's literally the same idea. As your sickness begins to progress with this type of illness that was sparked from complete ignorance, it means you are spiritually ascending into the fiery pits of Hell, symbolically. And this was in the making. It was a MISTAKE(do it once, it's a mistake. Do it again, and it's stupidity) which you would have avoided if you initially had chosen to follow God. There is a reason why our 1st century ancestors looked to God as a guide through life and I suggest people who are pushing him away to think again......... When this type of thing happens to you I bet the first place you will go is the exact opposite of where you would expect. Either Isolation(mental jail), actually physical jail, hospital, or graveyard. MAN!!! I ended up in isolation and in a actually jail cell a few times waiting for my court appearance for drug abuse!!!!

Stop thinking that ghost and stuff like that exist in the physical world. Never in my 30 years of life have I seen a ghost. I went into an abandoned haunted children's hospital for the mentally ill growing up and used to ride by it on my bike all the time. People would paint the pentagram with candles all over the entrance to attempt to summon ghosts...Apparently, where that hospital use to be, the woods were considered haunted because of the burial grounds where they buried mentally ill children. They have an actual cemetery but if you walk along hidden paths you will see stones with numbers marked for where they buried the excess of children before they closed down the hospital...And there is also a story of a girl from the hospital being lured into the woods and killed!!!!For all my years riding through there I never saw shit!!!!!! As a kid, I even rode through there at 2AM on my dirt bike and did not for a second think I was gonna see a ghost lol.

Although I am fully cured I will always remember this and I suggest people who are dealing with schizophrenia to seek medical help ASAP because I was cured after YEARS of this....As a result, I had gained 100lbs, started smoking cigarettes and am still dealing with alcoholism. Even after all that, I now to this day feel absolutely amazing. I'm free of the firm grasp the devil had on me. I swam back to shore. I honestly believe that rehab saved me from potential suicide. Trust in God and follow his words. God made you. He has an explanation and a cure for literally every illness you can imagine. Never feel alone. Don't associate yourself with people whose behavior is completely out of the norm of what is morally acceptable in modern day society. I sure as hell will never make that mistake again........ENDURE LIFE!!!!!!! There are no short cuts. Hard work will build character and character is what will help to prevent you from being mentally tortured, manipulated, and lured into darkness.

FYI, I had been unemployed for close to 5 YEARS while going through this absolute mess of an experience. I was a hard worker through my teen years and college so my family held me down. I graduated when I was 23 and landed my first job at 28!!!!!!!!!!!!Blew my fuckin 20s away over STUPID thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT BE A FUCKING WEIRDO!!! Fumbled many girls in college because of it!! So what your an engineer... You don't have to be a loser!!!! .........

Also.... As a science guy, you know that you can have ideas/theories about physical concepts, but if it can't be proven through math and follow fundamental laws, its merely an illusion.

Anyways........Few months and a couple of interviews later(I DID NOT mention anything about my experience prior to applying) I ended up landing an amazing job at an amazing company 😄😎.

Dry_Pie_223,"Im a 20 year of female. These past three months have been kinda crazy for me. I have struggled with my mental health my entire life. When I was young, around 10, my family and I noticed I was depressed and anxious. I had a lot of OCD symptoms too. I was addicted to drugs from 14-17, im clean now. Ive always been off, had intrusive thoughts about hurting people, myself. I have a lot of disrespect for myself. In the past ive had manic episodes.

In October I watched the Joker movie and everything kinda changed. I came out of the movie so happy like this buzzing in my head. I thought I was him. Like I wanted to go hurt somebody. and I just started getting this feeling like everything around me wasn't real. everything was a hologram. A couple days later I was too paranoid to leave the house I missed some days of school and work. When I did leave the house I went out with sunglasses, a scarf, and all my skin protected so that the influence of other people wouldn't seep into my skin. I thought the pigeons might have been watching me. Since then I stopped trusting my therapist. I dont trust my psychiatrist either. I dont want to be around anyone and I kinda just want to be all alone. My memory and my concentration has gotten so bad. Ive also become so inarticulate I stumble over every word and sound so dumb when I talk to my professors. It's only happened a couple times but sometimes it feels like peoples faces are morphing when I look at them. Or like they just dont look like they are humans, they look like they are aliens. But im not actually hallucinating anything. Or it feels like wings are about to grow out of my teachers back. 

I can leave the house and I am a very active person because I work at a gym. When I am at the gym I feel good and the thoughts and feelings almost completely go away. But sometimes I am reminded of them when this one member comes in. She is always talking about energies (she is a fortune teller) and she always reminds me that none of this is real and it's some version of a premeditated social experiment. sometimes it is harder to live the house and sometimes its really hard to come back into the house. there are periods when I am more scared of other people and the other times I dont even care at all. 

I cant watch movies with serious topics or mentally ill people or violence anymore because it riles me up. Ive been eating really poorly but ive been forcing myself into the shower. haven't brushed my teeth in a long time. The days blur together and I feel like everything is one. I feel like I dissociate a lot. 

A lot of the time I feel like I am just making all of this up. Like it isn't even happening and I am faking it all for attention or something. And that I am perfectly fine and need to just get over myself and do my work.

Ive been really confused and scared and frustrated and tired. Has anyone ever felt like this before? does any of this make sense? I wanna just hear from people, if anyone has anything to say about it. ",2024-11-18 04:22:19,Unknown,10,1gtq1t3,4,schizophrenia,Something has been happening to me and I dont know what's going on,1.0
Unlucky-Crow3193,"Hello everyone, I am new here. I recently joined Reddit all together to maybe learn and read about other’s experiences about romantic relationships and schizophrenia. My boyfriend is diagnosed schizophrenic. I will apologize in advance if this isn’t the appropriate place to post or if I say the wrong thing. I am so tired and desperate.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half.* A little over a month into dating he disclosed his diagnosis, his psychotic break and where he is at now with his care. I was shocked. I’ve never met anyone with schizophrenia before and it does sound like a scary thing. I was already in love with this guy. I dove into articles, podcasts, etc to learn and he was open to questions. I myself live with anxiety, depression and ptsd related to abuse. Although no illness is the same I understood the road to “managing” symptoms and the stigma of it all. But we were in this together and so fucking in love. He treats me like a queen. He’s mostly shy and reserved with people, he doesn’t have many friends. With me he is hilarious and outgoing and so romantic. 

What I know is he has not had hallucinations or delusions other than his initial break. He experiences most negative and some disorganized symptoms. However I could be wrong. The antipsychotic medication he has been on for years is a shot varying every 4-6 weeks. He sees a therapist here and there and his med doctor every 3 months or so. I’ve gone with him to his appointments and sat in with him and his doctor a few times. 

Every so often he would get in weird moods starting with some negative symptoms and resulting in a total change of heart about something big in his life. His job, his family, and me. All occurring close to the time he is scheduled to get his shot. Example one day he wanted to quit his job which he has held and done great for 5 years, because his boss told him he was working too slow in the new position he moved into. He took a few days off, adjusted his medication and moved back into his old position. Now he’s a manager in his old position. Then there is me, he has broken up with me several times. I’ve noticed this happens after we spend some time apart and just busy with life. Average relationship stuff. Some examples of break up reason are he doesn’t have enough time for the gym or personal things, he has too many errands or too busy, he is unsure of the relationship (valid). The first time he destroyed my heart. We were apart for a month. I didn’t want to see him but he won me over again. Then it happened again, apart for 2 weeks. Then again, apart for 2 days. Surely you are wondering why I took him back. Love is tricky like that. I don’t know. When we were on and stable everything was fantastic. We took trips, did fun things, boring things, all the things. So many plans for the future and we have so many things/interests/faith in common. Every time we “got back together” our bond felt stronger, we connected more and worked hard on overcoming the break up and building a better foundation. We became more serious, which meant it only hurt more when he ended it the next time. 

I’ve asked him several times why he thinks he changes his mind about me like this. He always answers “my mother.” So here is the other side of the story. His overbearing mother. Maybe that’s not the right word, you tell me. She’s a sweet woman who has been through a lot, divorce, narcissistic abuse and it appears currently a drinking problem. Although I came to love her dearly over time I started to believe she doesn't think her son can function in the world without her. She manages his finances, bills, even his schedule at times. Oh, he lives with her. Having a serious gf, his first serious gf really threw a wrench in that. We spent a lot of time with her so she wouldn't feel lonely or left out. But as in love as we are we wanted privacy. He started to spend a lot of time at my home. Soon after we were talking about marriage s d moving in together. He has even named our future children. We took a pre marriage course at our church (we met at church forgot to mention). The more serious we became about our plans the more “doubts” he exhibited. Sometimes normal, change is very scary. But he would be completely excited about the plans on those days we spent alone away from his mother or when he chose not to tell her things but always became hesitant after sharing our plans with her. During our relationship he has disclosed that he feels like she “puts thoughts” in his head convincing him this relationship is not good, that his plans with me won’t work out. That our relationship will fail, just like hers have. Talking him out of it. The first time he mentioned moving out to her she yelled at him and chased him around the house he had to leave the house for the night. He fears she is taking his money. He feels used and like she depends on him for companionship. Yeah, it’s a lot.

So again he broke up with me 6 weeks ago. A week later we met and talked and he had changed. I mean he changed. I’ve never seen him be so determined and certain of anything. He said to me he’s all in,  no more looking back. He wanted to move in together after his mom’s big birthday trip. He talked to his mother about it and they sat down to figure out finances so he can manage it on his own. She created a spreadsheet with all the info he would need. He packed a few bags and stayed here for a while. He even brought his plants. We reorganized, he had space in the house. Our home. He was so happy and his mom finally seemed onboard. Days went by and she refused to send the spreadsheet, “l’ll do it later lets talk after my trip.” Last Sunday afternoon he was to pick his mom up from the airport and thn dinner with her. After that he would go to his friend’s house to dog sit for a few days. I was staying home. He was planning on having an important and much needed talk with his mom that evening at dinner about boundaries and his intentions of being completely moved in with me by the end of the month and her needing to understand that he wants to start his own family. That this is happening with or without her approval.

I didn’t hear from him the rest of Sunday. I figured it got intense and it got late. When he hits that tired/sleepy wall there is no stopping him from crashing out. Anyways, no call no text. I waited until morning. Called no answer. No text. I was now very worried. He texted me a few hours laters saying he had a terrible night and he was taking a mental health day off work to go to his doctor. I asked what was happening and if I could come. All he said was No. I can’t do this. I feel like I’m living two different lives. So I came home from work that day to find all his things gone and a typed up letter telling me goodbye and to refrain from contacting him and that my house key was under the mat. No I love you, no I’m sorry. He didn’t write that.

This has broken me and my own mental health. I’m trying my best to pick up the pieces and take care of myself. But I’m going mad trying to figure out what the hell happened. Is he ok? All I ever wanted to do was to love and take care of this man as my partner and my best friend. I've been patient and understanding maybe too much. Despite all of this, the time spent with him has been some of the happiest of my whole life. I’ve been in love before but this is different, I love his soul and spirit. I miss him dearly. I pictured us together, a family, a life. 

Any insight? I’m already heartbroken. Please be kind and thank you so much for reading.",2024-06-13 13:10:48,Unknown,26,1detdda,11,schizophrenia,Is it the illness or something else? I'm so heartbroken and concerned,1.0
Warm-Lack4159,"I have no one to talk to. My psychotic break & thought broadcasting delusions plus mental deterioration from psychosis have left me zombified when it comes to real life interaction & I have isolated to the extreme. My social anxiety was bad before but is now debilitating because I dont remember how to interact with people irl & every interaction is painful. I either interrupt by responding too quickly or if asked a question, too slowly & stupidly (no focus, forgetting basic words & phrases, extreme memory lapses & extensive memory recall issues).

I can barely focus on reading (avid reader before) & I am so sensitive to external stimuli, particularly sounds (my PTSD makes me jumpy) & smells. I used to love music but it now makes me super emotional & I start crying at songs I used to enjoy. That & I feel like I need to listen to new music because I had certain songs & artists play a central role in psychosis. The only thing I enjoy anymore is food (talk about being in survival mode) but it's such a brief satisfaction compared to the length of every day. I just want to sit inside & eat. I don't know what to focus on & when I do try to focus, I struggle & get frustrated & move onto the next thing.

I don't want to leave my bed- if I do, I don't want to leave the house. I just realized thought broadcasting isn't real a couple weeks ago. I am still getting stabilized on my meds, which I am able to get through government assistance. I will also be able to go back to school with government help next semester & [ideally/hopefully with my schizophrenic diagnosis] get on disability- which isn't enough but I cannot work. I am actually severely disabled mentally & it's affecting my physical health as well. 

However, I spent & lost all my money during my psychosis. I still dont remember how exactly or where it went but I am assuming lots towards drugs. Not taking my mental state & dependence on government assistance seriously I stupidly got a job 2 weeks ago at Amazon as a delivery driver because of my recent money issues. The night before I started my driving job I got into a car accident & totalled my car. Mind you, after psychosis I noticed my driving was off, somehow. Mental issue or maybe perception, idk. Now my anxiety is too high to manage while I'm at work driving (it was already high with social anxiety & constant questioning of my own mind) & my depression has robbed me of motivation to do things on my day off.. my excuse is work is more than enough. It definitely puts me in the energy negatives. I'm upset because I actually had a pretty healthy schedule prior to this job- I was going to IOP & exercising & forcing myself to read & study but now I feel constantly overwhelmed & it's triggered my addictive side- which I've been keeping under control since my hospitalization. I'm going to quit & I feel like a failure for that but my mental health is so poor, plus I need to find a car.

I am living with my family which is supporting me through this time. Luckily for me they can do that because right now I am unable to work. I just feel so badly about my mental state but I am in shambles. I fake it in front of my brother that hates me because of my past as an addict (& he is dealing with a recent bipolar/schizoaffective break- I'm diagnosed schizophrenic) & my father.

It's a beautiful day out today & I should go for a walk but it will be a good day if I just do my hair & read a little bit & run the couple errands I have to do (signing up for the local pool & exercise hall is 1- I gained lots of weight through hospitalization & isolation this summer). Time is flying by but my mental state keeps deteriorating. I've never been suicidal until this episode & waking up every morning is excrutiating.

I think I need internet community support because in person interaction is too much.",2024-11-06 19:22:24,Unknown,7,1gkyzda,1,schizophrenia,Reaching out for support,1.0
Iamonlytrying,"I am curious since have been diagnosed with a schizophrenia without voices or hallucinations, but I tend to see something and turn in to something it's not from the fear i have for it. Does that make sense? I feel like that's not having a hallucination, but having distorted thinking pattern. I also have been to many psychiatrist that are trying to figure out what it is. I have been told it's just anxiety with ocd or ocd. They even said maybe it's psychosis. I've had it for 2 years and every month it gets worse and I feel like I'm going crazy. I have intrusive thoughts about my partner cheating and I get scared I don't love my partner. But it's more than that, I am paranoid to everyone around, which makes me think they are out to get me. I get so suicidal,thinking that this is all permanent. Please, tell me that maybe this will get better over time. Ive tried many antipsychotics, which limits me so I've had to stop. Had bad reactions to them. Antidepressants and lamictal along with buspar only gets me so far through the day. I feel so alone in this battle. I just want someone to understand me and tell that it's going to be okay. Sorry to be so pessimistic, there's so many things happening in my life with my abusive parents, mental health issues, and of course my husband having so much depression from my mental disorder. If there is something you can tell me, it might help. Thanks so much for listening
I don't have any friends and I moved away from my family. Plus, I have autism and social anxiety combined so I'm not the best with befriending others. ",2024-11-27 00:08:09,Unknown,4,1h0j5um,2,schizophrenia,A  mental health rant ,1.0
ExplorerPretty5622,"tw: mentions of self-harm/suicide (I am not actively in danger.)

hi! i just got diagnosed last week after experiencing delusions and disorganized thoughts and psychosis and whatnot, for about 2 years. I am almost 29. is it normal to be diagnosed late in your 20s? I thought schizophrenia was the type of thing you would find out about during adolescence, like some other conditions. but I guess I'm conflating schizophrenia with mental illness, when it's more of a neurological disorder, right?

i have these episodes where I believe I'm in a simulation, and the only way to wake up from it is to harm/k*ll myself. I just kind of sit and shiver in fear while my wife tries to comfort and ground me. eventually it passes, and then I'm back to my normal, goofy self. but for those crucial minutes or hours...I'm someone else, it feels like. like all the knowledge of the universe was put into my brain accidentally, but only for a brief glitch.

i was prescribed Lamotrigine and we increased my Abilify I was already on, and we're going to taper down my antianxiety and antidepressants due to the change in diagnosis. it always used to just be depression, then anxiety, then ADHD, and now this, including mania.

I guess it's just a lot of information for me to absorb all at once. And there's so much more to my delusions: old gods, deities as voices in my head, or believing I'm a robot or even seeing ghosts.

anyways, it's nice to meet y'all. any thoughts are welcome.",2024-12-11 05:50:22,Unknown,0,1hbgnlt,6,schizophrenia,"newly diagnosed schizoaffective, seeking advice",1.0
